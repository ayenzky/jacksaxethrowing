Broken down, it sounds like a specialized tool, something you might use to store and organize materials before putting them online or saving reference materials. In reality, though, CMS platforms are everywhere. WordPress is a CMS and so is Drupal, and there are dozens of others. Once you understand that every website is dependent on CMS infrastructure, the importance of such tools becomes clear.\n\nWith that in mind, then, how do you know if you have the right CMS platform? Consider these 4 factors as you navigate this complex marketplace. The right host is the one designed for your niche, so [stay outcome-focused](http://spyrestudios.com/importance-outcome-focused-web-design-strong-host-can-help/) as you assess your options. It’s all about results, after all.\n\nThink Support\n-------------\n\nFor those who are relatively new to web design, the level of support available for a given CMS platform can be a big factor when selecting one for your own site. For example, WordPress is the most popular CMS because it’s used not only for business sites but also for many free, personal pages – it [has over 24 million installations](https://www.comparethecloud.net/articles/choosing-right-cms-business_-way-forward/). Because so many people are using the platform, then, there are tons of support boards online, as well as a robust customer service team.\n\nCompared to WordPress, a CMS like Drupal has only 1.3 million installs and Typo3 and Concrete5 follow Drupal at a distance with 500,000 and 140,000 installations, respectively. Though the users for these platforms are passionate about them, you’re far less likely to find beginner-friendly support for these systems.\n\nKnow Your Field\n---------------\n\nJust like WordPress is ideal for personal and small business websites, some other industries have niche CMS platforms. For example, in 2015, all Australian government departments were made to migrate online. In doing so, it became clear that most of the sites were very similar. In order to save money and reduce redundancies, local firm [Bliss Media](https://www.blissmedia.com.au/) helped the government streamline the process [by developing govCMS](https://www.blissmedia.com.au/blog/govcms-what-is-it-and-what-options-are-available), a single CMS platform that could be adapted for any Australian government site with both PaaS and SaaS options.\n\nOf course, many other governments could likely make use of govCMS, not just those in Australia, but this was decidedly a targeted solution. If you ask around within your industry, you’re likely to find similar solutions exist.\n\nTo Host Or Not To Host\n----------------------\n\nMost CMS systems offer multiple hosting options, specifically designed so you can keep your system onsite and host it through your own servers, or you can just buy the software and run it remotely.\n\nFor most businesses, SaaS is a better option than on-site hosting because you aren’t responsible for server failures, the software is typically [more flexible and always up to date](https://beat.10ztalk.com/how-to-choose-the-right-cms-platform-the-definitive-guide/), and the company takes care of the IT side of things. Even advanced web designers can benefit from SaaS – and these systems grow with your audience.\n\nStudy Security\n--------------\n\nFinally, security is a top concern for web users today, so if you’re using a platform without proper protections, you’ll see your user base decline. Some CMS systems [support security plugins](https://www.webpagefx.com/blog/web-design/how-to-evaluate-what-cms-to-use/), while others allow you to restrict different users access settings. Make sure to ask plenty of questions about your security options before settling on a CMS so that you don’t wind up facing a user privacy scandal.\n\nThere’s no single CMS system that’s right for everyone. Instead, it’s important that you understand exactly what your end goal is and pursue it through your choice of platform. Take your time and don’t jump into a decision just because you want to get your site built. This decision will impact your site’s performance in the long term.\nThousands of organizations just like these use open source cms to run their websites because they are more often than not; easier to customize, typically more cost effective, easier to support and maintain, and usually integrate with 3rd party apps and software much better.\n\nWith open source software, you can keep your software up to date, never worry about obsolescence, and don’t have to keep learning how to use new programs because a developer doesn’t want to support its older products. Check out the infographic below to learn more about how open source software has changed the way people build websites.\n\nUsing the traditional monolitic approach whereby you build, manage and publish your website on a single server, there is a more distributed approach whereby you build your site on a Static Site Generator, publish the site on GIT repositories and host the site on a Content Delivery Network.\n\n**Choosing between a Git-based CMS or an API-driven CMS**\n\nWith a Git-based CMS you can publish content every time you push changes to Git, allowing for a seamless development workflow. This approach is a bit difficult to scale with content that you want to publish across different platforms, but it will allow for you to have a purely static website. Since it runs on Git, you won’t have a problem finding an open source CMS to work with.\n\nWith an API-driven CMS, you’re creating content that will be strictly delivered via APIs. Although you won’t be able to keep track of content changes through Git, you’ll be able to scale your content through flexible APIs. But since you are working on a platform that hosts these APIs (server bandwidth ain’t cheap) these tend to not be open-sourced and rather pricey, but some offer freemium pricing models.\n\nOr use **[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com)**, which in essence can be an API driven Git-based CMS.\n\n#### Author: Spyrestudios Blogger\n\n",

With a [dedicated APP](http://app.webriq.com), we have been able to build, develop, update and manage hunderds of sites.\nIn this model we are using a Static Site Generator to develop the site, a GIT based CMS system to update the content and a Github repository to store all HTML, CSS and Javascript files. GIT files are pushed to a CDN network. \nWhereas this model does fit well for most smaller projects, it has it's shortfalls when it comes to larger projects or projects with a need for frequent content updates and updates made by a variety of users, content writers and third party contributions \n\nSince the JAM Stack is more a concept then a real technology stack, we have been contemplating for a while how we could combine the best of the traditional LAMP Stack ideas and the serious advantages and benefits of the JAM Stack.

With a [dedicated APP](http://app.webriq.com), we have been able to build, develop, update and manage hunderds of sites.\nIn this model we are using a Static Site Generator to develop the site, a GIT based CMS system to update the content and a Github repository to store all HTML, CSS and Javascript files. GIT files are pushed to a CDN network. \nWhereas this model does fit well for most smaller projects, it has it's shortfalls when it comes to larger projects or projects with a need for frequent content updates and updates made by a variety of users, content writers and third party contributions \n\nSince the JAM Stack is more a concept then a real technology stack, we have been contemplating for a while how we could combine the best of the traditional LAMP Stack ideas and the serious advantages and benefits of the JAM Stack. It's what I would call the GLUE of the JAM Stack.\n\n# What are we gluing together\nA comprehensive Database (MongoDB) Service\nhttps://www.mongodb.com\n\nA Javascript (Node.js) API Content Management Framework\nhttps://strapi.io\n\nA State of the Art Static Site Generator\nhttps://www.gatsbyjs.org\n\nAn ultra-redundant global CDN\nhttps://www.netlify.com\n\n#### GET EARLY BIRD ACCESS TO[ WEBRIQ JAM STACK for ENTERPRISES](http://madmarketing.webriq.services/f/3) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "\nHowever,the continuous increase in e-commerce consumption by people has also led torise in the competition for retailers. The best way to stay abreast ofcompetition is to optimize your e-store according to the latest trends. Now,when it comes to e-commerce, several on-going trends are expected to stayafloat in 2016. \n\n**Beloware some of the biggest trends that will dominate in the e-commerce industry in2016:**\n\n**1.Wider Adoption of Responsive Design**\n\nNearly 66 percent of user's time spent on e-shops is done using mobile devices. And, 61 percent of consumers abandon an e-commerce site if it isn’t mobile-friendly. Thus, it's imperative that your online shop must be optimized for Smartphones and tablets. Put it simply, having a site adjusted to multiple devices withdifferent screen sizes has become a hard-to-ignore priority than ever before.This clearly suggests that the adoption of responsive design is only going togrow rapidly. \n\nDespite offering a streamlined viewing experience, responsive design has beenimplemented in only nine percent e-commerce sites. However, realizing thesignificance of responsive design, more and more e-commerce website owners areturning to RWD approach. \n\n**2.Flat Design: “When Less is More”**\n\nMost e-commerce stores are usually cluttered with stylistic elements like gradients,textures, and drop shadows, to name a few. But using such elements decreases usability. And so, many e-commerce sites owners have started following the “Less is more” motto to make their site user-friendly. Basically, retailers are making use of flat design templates to bring clarity and simplicity to their design. Rather than using stylistic elements, a flat design includes subtle elements, including bold colors, iconography, grid and much more. \n\nOne great example of flat styling is Canopy. You can use this site to get inspiration for applying flat design to an e-shop – that features a clean and minimalistic design with plenty of white space that quickly brings the user focus on the products.\n\n**3. Useof Split Screens Will Increase**\n\nIn case you want to give prominence to a few products (ideally two products)simultaneously, on your e-commerce site then you can make use of split screens to fulfill such a need. Besides, helping you promote two of the most important items in your store, split screens also provide another benefit. You can showcase your primary product on the side of the layout, and on the opposite side, you can display additional information about that product. \n\nFor example, [bellroy.com](http://bellroy.com/) (a site that sells wallets and several other accessories) is designed with splitscreens. Below is an image of the site containing a passport sleeve on one sideof the product page, while the right side is used for displaying a travel wallet. \n\n**4. More Finger-Friendly Interfaces**\n\nAs people prefer mobile devices for making purchases online, it's important that your site can enable visitors to interact with a web page in a seamless manner. One best way to achieve such an objective is to make your e-commerce site interfacemore finger-friendly. Well, since consumers have become accustomed to usingfingertips for interacting with a page, apparently they'll possibly would wantto use multi-touch gestures for navigating through your e-commerce site. \n\nE-commerce website interfaces designed keeping in mind finger friendliness will most likely have two impacts. Firstly, the use of content sliders will reduce. Though such sliders have proved quite useful in showing plenty of informationin small screen displays, but users find it hard to click on the small-sizenext buttons of the content sliders. Secondly, use of larger CTAs will increaseas they help provide an enhanced shopping experience to users.  \n\n**5. Add a Personalized Touch With Custom-Drawn Illustrations**\n\nIn today's highly competitive e-commerce industry, site owners resort to several techniques and tactics that could help in making their e-shop look unique and apersonal touch to it. And, one emerging trend that can assist you in accomplishing such a goal is to make use of hand drawn (custom) illustrations.Thus, you should consider adding hand-drawn stickers to your e-commerce siteinstead of the stickers available online. Also, you must think about adding alarge illustrated background. \n\nFor example, [Merrell](http://www.merrell.com/US/en) uses a fully illustrated background that not just add a realistic touch to the layout, but also help deliver the site's message in an interactive yet easy-to-understand manner. Despite using plenty of illustrations, this e-commerce site doesn't compromise on usability.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n ",

To “install” a bot,  you simply search for the bot from within your favorite messaging app and click to start chatting. The bot has immediate access to your identity, too. For a mobile app, you open your app store, search for the app, click install, wait a minute to install, open the app, and login/create an account. You’re looking at a few minutes rather than a few seconds. The bot install results in at least a 10X reduction in friction.\n\nBots are easily distributed. Let’s say your friends are all using some awesome bot, they can easily share the bot with you from the messaging app itself. Bots can be [linked to](https://www.messenger.com/t/webriqhq), shared on socialmedia, and even recommended by other bots. In the case of [Slack](https://locl.co/meya/slack), another team member can add your bot so that your whole team can use it.\n\nQuality mobile apps are expensive to build, maintain and deploy. In the app paradigm, you need to have skilled Android and iOS client development teams ideally paired with a strong UXer or two. Then the app needs to be tested, refined and submitted to app stores for approvals. Rinse and repeat. In the bot world, you leverage the fact that messaging apps are built by someone else. New feature deployment can be done with continuous integration to the backend alone.\n\nThere is a very long-tail of use-cases that don’t justify a mobile app. Because of the low-friction install, distribution and development of a bot, a whole slew of use-cases open up. Users won’t likely install an app for their dentist or hairdresser. Therefore, to build dedicated apps for these use-cases would be futile. Instead, would that same user add their dentist and hairdresser to their contact list?\n\nMessaging apps are ubiquitous and dominate consumer’s mobile engagement. Between Facebook Messenger, iMessage, WhatsApp, Kik, Line, Viber, Telegram, Slack and Hangouts messaging has almost complete market penetration. On top of this, messaging has [5.6Xhigher 12-month retention](http://www.statista.com/statistics/417780/mobile-messenger-app-retention/) than other mobile apps.\n\nConsumers are experiencing mobile [app fatigue](http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/03/app-fatigue/). What’s the last app that made it onto your home screen? How many apps did you install this month? \n\nBot interactions are intrinsically bi-directional. In the web and mobile app paradigm you need to provide contact info and/or rely on push notifications for the “receive” component of the UX. These notifications have to be stitched together by links and intents into the corresponding UI view. In messaging, incoming messages are a first-class citizen. This lends itself nicely to commerce and financial transactions which are, by definition, bi-directional.\n\nMoving complexity to the cloud reduces a user’s cognitive load. Sure, you can always search Google, comb through results, click a few links, extract out the necessary information, and formulate a decision. However, isn’t it easier if a bot did that for you? Thisis especially useful when on the go or when time is limited.\n\nBots are extremely portable. While messaging apps are a bot’s native environment, they can just as easily exist in live chat, personal assistants , car audio systems, [as a voice in your ear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_%28film%29), smart watches, email, and push notifications.\n\nBot software development cycles are extremely fast. The first time the request can be serviced manually, then an automated version can be deployed behind the scenes. You get the added benefit of not wasting time building the wrong thing.\n\nHumans are innately hardwired for language and conversation. Because of this language has evolved to become powerful, nuanced, and flexible. It goes without saying, but language has been used extensively for all of recorded history to do amazing things. Bots leverage this underlying human trait.\n\n##  **Bots go beyond devices**\n\nToday’s apps may be inextricable from their mobile hosts, but apps remain a far more flexible technology than their predecessors. Apps let us keep our favorite software products in our pockets and use them wherever we go, whenever, so long as we have a web hook-up. Bots are the new apps because they go beyond devices and provide a new version of mobility. Not only are we able to use bot technology anywhere in the world , but we can use the bot across multiple devices and interact with it in a variety of ways. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella calls this “[conversation as a platform](http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-conversations-as-a-platform-and-chatbots-2016-3).” Rather than tapping, swiping, and searching, we will be able to just talk to bots to get exactly what we need. It’s the convenience of apps taken to the next level.\n\n## **Bots are friendly**\n\nFacebook understands the No. 1rule of marketing - forging an emotional connection is the secret to customer loyalty. When I see a happy memory from the past, the memory makes me feel good and I transfer those feelings to Facebook.\n\nBots go further by making the emotional connection a seemingly two-way experience. Users may feel like their bots are their buddies, virtual friends they can joke with, who could grow to know their true selves. And bots are programmed to make users believe this is possible. [Mezi](http://mezi.com/), an AI-powered shopping bot, is programmed to feel like the user’s best friend who also happens to be an expert shopper. It’s easy to see how shopping with a code-based best friend could inspire even more feelings of good-will than the occasional Facebook memory.\n\n## **Bots are multi-purpose**\n\nApple killed the iPod because people prefered to listen to music on their iPhones. Smartwatch sales fell flat because they didn’t offer a radically new functionality. Tablets are on the decline. These stories speak to a trend in consumer technology: downsizing.

Before long though, most of your visitors are greeted with one of these:\n\n**INTERNAL SERVER ERROR 500**\n\n**BAD GATEWAY – 502 ERROR**\n\nYour server is down, and so is your website.\n\nBut there’s another way. A way to have a website that never goes down. A website that quietly maintains itself, is safe and secure, and remains unchanged as it goes from 100 visitors a month to 100 visitors a minute.\n\nThe idea of a single server serving traffic for a website harks back toan age of mainframes and ISDN lines. But the demands of scale and perfect uptime killed the mainframe. Maybe it’s time they killed single-server sites as well.\n\nA server is a complicated piece of equipment. It needs to be updated. Any of the two hundred processes running on it has the power to cripple the machine. It will stubbornly refuse to serve more requests than it can handle. It will shutdown in the middle of the night, or the middle of your vacation.\n\nYour homepage and marketing pages shouldn’t need to connect to a database. If your marketing site is opening a database connection just to render, you have a very finite limit on how many requests you can serve.\n\n**Think of the browser as your new server.** You get a brand new shiny one dedicated to every user who visits your site. It can make requests. It can make decisions. It can show what you want when you want. But unlike an actual server, it can interact with the user instantly, show helpful feedback, and look great.

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\nIt’s 3am. Your website has just gone viral. Thousands of visitors are pouring in to learn about your company, and possibly become customers. Before long though, most of your visitors are greeted with one of these:\n\n**INTERNAL SERVER ERROR 500**\n\n**BAD GATEWAY – 502 ERROR**\n\nYour server is down, and so is your website.\n\nBut there’s another way. A way to have a website that never goes down. A website that quietly maintains itself, is safe and secure, and remains unchanged as it goes from 100 visitors a month to 100 visitors a minute.\n\nThe idea of a single server serving traffic for a website harks back toan age of mainframes and ISDN lines. But the demands of scale and perfect uptime killed the mainframe. Maybe it’s time they killed single-server sites as well.\n\nA server is a complicated piece of equipment. It needs to be updated. Any of the two hundred processes running on it has the power to cripple the machine. It will stubbornly refuse to serve more requests than it can handle. It will shutdown in the middle of the night, or the middle of your vacation.\n\nYour homepage and marketing pages shouldn’t need to connect to a database. If your marketing site is opening a database connection just to render, you have a very finite limit on how many requests you can serve.\n\n**Think of the browser as your new server.** You get a brand new shiny one dedicated to every user who visits your site. It can make requests. It can make decisions. It can show what you want when you want. But unlike an actual server, it can interact with the user instantly, show helpful feedback, and look great. It can do more than simply display what your web server spits out.\n\nSo lose your web server. Host your site by uploading some HTML and JavaScript to the cloud, and let it be served to your users from a content delivery network with servers around the world. Upload yourfiles manually, use a static site host like [WebriQ](http://www.app.webriq.com/auth/register), or an [open-sourcetool](https://github.com/EagerIO/Stout).\n\nNothing can compare to the simplicity of knowing your site can handle all the traffic in the world and still remain fast and reliable.

A straight forward Markdown editor that works pretty much like any WYSIWYG editor, let's you publish, edit and manage all sorts of content. The content is directly written in to Github repositories, depending on you creating drafts or published posts. Each time you publish an update on the Github repository a new build will be triggered and your update will be published within seconds. The content model is based on Ember collections and can be adapted according to the specific needs of your website or Web APP. You only manage the dynamic data that you really want to manage.

It is basically a free CMS developed to build static websites. Being a CMS for static site generators, it gives non-technical users an easy way to add/edit/delete content to any website developed with a static site generator.

Moreover, since all the websites are static and have no scripts that can be injected with malware or no database to connect to, it is pretty secure as compared to other platforms available out there. With WebriQ pages, service attacks denial, outdated scripts, and malware are all things of the past. \n\n#### Stunning UI/UX Designs\n\nSince the CMS does not require you to setup and create complex database structures for the site, the webmaster can be invested in building beautiful User interface designs that improve user experience on your site. Consequently, it improves user engagement on your website with reduced bounce rate. \n\n#### Complete Control\n\nWebriQ Pages gives you complete control over all the elements of your site be it the content or code of your site. It allows you to make changes to the content or the code whenever necessary. \n\n**WebriQshops**, as the name suggests, allows you to create e-commerce stores to sell any type of products you want.\n<br>\n### Features of WebriQshops:\n\n#### API Enabled\n\nWebriQshops comes with a storefront and Admin API to enable external integrations. You can also make connections with Restful JSON API.\n\n#### Variety of shipping engines and payments\n\nIt also comes integrated with a huge range of shipping and payment methods into the standard shopping cart application.\n\n#### Fast and Secure\n\nThe shopping cart application uses optimal computer resources and performs extremely fast.

Open the official website i.e. https://www.webriq.com/#page-top and click create a free account. \n\nUpon clicking the button, you will be redirected to a site creation wizard where you will be asked to select the type of website you want to create i.e. page or shop. When you choose page option, you will be asked to choose a template. For a free account, there are 4 different templates to choose from i.e. WebriQ Business, WebriQ Portfolio, WebriQ Landing Page, WebriQ Starter Page.

It is basically a free CMS developed to build static websites. Being a CMS for static site generators, it gives non-technical users an easy way to add/edit/delete content to any website developed with a static site generator. It allows you to create any type of website including news or community portal, multilingual E-commerce and complex multisite.\n\nWebriQ comes with a parser tool and state-of-the-art CSS Template, capable of incorporating any custom design into the CMS platform. The complete platform is developed on an open source software and is now available to use on a monthly subscription plan. \n\n### How does it work?\n\nWebriQ CMS is a single page app that helps you create a clean and user-friendly User Interface for editing content stored in your GIT repository. \n\nIn order to get started, you need to first setup a YAML config to define the content model of your website and modify the main layout of the CMS to meet your site design needs. When you click on /admin, you will be redirected automatically to the login page where you'll be able to create or edit content as per your needs.\n\nWebriQ CMS is available in two different options – WebriQpages and WebriQshops \n\n**WebriQ pages** option allows you to create, manage and publish a variety of different pages ideal for setting up blogs, personal portfolios, business sites or more.\n<br>\n### Features of WebriQ pages options\n\n#### SuperFast and Secure\n\nUnlike other single server based sites, websites created with this CMS option are served through a CDN which drastically reduces the latency, and offers 100% uptime and much faster downloads. Moreover, since all the websites are static and have no scripts that can be injected with malware or no database to connect to, it is pretty secure as compared to other platforms available out there. With WebriQ pages, service attacks denial, outdated scripts, and malware are all things of the past. \n\n#### Stunning UI/UX Designs\n\nSince the CMS does not require you to setup and create complex database structures for the site, the webmaster can be invested in building beautiful User interface designs that improve user experience on your site. Consequently, it improves user engagement on your website with reduced bounce rate. \n\n#### Complete Control\n\nWebriQ Pages gives you complete control over all the elements of your site be it the content or code of your site. It allows you to make changes to the content or the code whenever necessary. \n\n**WebriQshops**, as the name suggests, allows you to create e-commerce stores to sell any type of products you want.\n<br>\n### Features of WebriQshops:\n\n#### API Enabled\n\nWebriQshops comes with a storefront and Admin API to enable external integrations. You can also make connections with Restful JSON API.\n\n#### Variety of shipping engines and payments\n\nIt also comes integrated with a huge range of shipping and payment methods into the standard shopping cart application.\n\n#### Fast and Secure\n\nThe shopping cart application uses optimal computer resources and performs extremely fast. Being inline with PCI Compliance and best industry practices, WebriQ Shop is a very secure solution for businesses looking to establish their online presence.\n\n#### 100% Responsive Solution\n\nThe admin and storefront elements of this CMS are optimized for tablet and mobile devices along with various other screen sizes available out there.\n<br>\n<br>\n##  How to build reliable, secure and scalable websites with the WebriQ Platform?\n\nFor a matter of fact, WebriQ provides a demo site to help you know how the platform works and what features it has. \n\n### Step 1: Creating an account\n\n<img src=\"  /img/uploads/creating-an-account.png  \">\n<br>\nIn order to create a site on WebriQ Platform, you first need to create an account with WebriQ.

In essence, you generate a static HTML-only website using CMS-likeconcepts such as templates. The content can be extracted from a database but, more typically, Markdown files are used. These files are also the basis of the CMS system, enabling you to update any content on the fly.\n\nThe site generation can occur on your development machine or staging server. The resulting HTML files are then deployed to a live webserver. Users will never know the difference.\n\nA related concept is a _“Headless”_or _“Decoupled”_CMS. These use an interface such as WordPress to handle content administration but allow other systems to access the data via a [RESTAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). One of the better implementations based on the Github Rest API, is [WEBRIQ CMS](http://demo.webriq.com/). \n\nPopular static site generators include [Roots](http://www.roots.cx/) (used for WebriQ CMS) , [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) and [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/).\n\n## Major BENEFITS of STATIC WEBSITES\n\n###  **1. Flexibility**\n\nCMSs normally constrain your options, because they’re tied to a database with specific fields. If you want to add a Twitter widget to some pages, you’ll normally require a plugin, a short code or some custom functionality.\n\nIn a static site, the widget can simply be inserted into a file directly or using a partial/snippet. There are very few limits, because you’re unshackled by the those imposed by a CMS.\n\n###  **2. Better Performance**\n\nMost CMS applications offer built-in or plugin-powered cache systems to ensure pages are generated and reused when possible. This is effective, although the overhead of managing, validating and re-generating cached pages remains.\n\nStatic sites are pre-cached pages which never expire. Files can also be minified prior to deployment to guarantee the smallest load. A static site will always perform better than a CMS-powered version using a similar template.\n\n###    **3. Fewer Server-side Dependencies**\n\nA typical WordPress installation requires:\n\n - a suitable operating system such as Ubuntu or CentOS\n\n - a web server such as Apache or NGINX\n\n - PHP with associated extensions and web server configurations\n\n - MySQLor PostgreSQL\n\n - WordPress application\n\n - any necessary plugins\n\n - the theme/template code.\n\nThese dependencies must be installed and managed. WordPress requires less effort than some other applications, but it’s still possible for a single update to any part to cause chaos.\n\nA static site is lightweight, and can be hosted by any web server able to return HTML files. There is nothing else to install, manage or update.\n\n###  **4. Improved reliability**\n\n A CMS is complex, with many moving parts and points of failure. Run a WordPress site for any length of time and you’ll almost certainly encounter the dreaded _“Failedto establish a database connection”_error. Unforeseen CMS problems can arise from sudden traffic surges, which crash the database or restrict active connections.\n\nServing a static site is less intensive — the server just has to return flat files. It’s still possible to crash a web server, but it’ll take considerably more concurrent requests.\n\n###  **5. Superior Security**\n\nThere are several reasons why someone may want to attack your website. Traffic hijacking, rogue advertising, linking, authenticity spoofing and malware hosting all permit an unauthorized user to make monetaryand/or kudos gains.\n\nA CMS opens a number of attack vectors. The most obvious is the login screen: it’s only as secure as the weakest user password. Be aware that any page running server-side code also offers potential exploits — for example, firing spam emails via your contact form. It may not be obvious that someone has gained access; the worst culprits want to stay hidden.\n\nA static site has little or no server-side functionality. You cannot access it via scripting or database security holes. Someone could still gain access via SSH or FTP, but they would struggle to do much damage other than defacing pages or uploading files. \n\n###  **6. Client Control Considerations**\n\nYou spend weeks building attractive CMS themes for the client to trash their site within minutes of your hand-over. Using a CMS is not necessarily easy, and it offers considerable power to content editors. You can lock down rights such as plugin installation, but it won’t prevent someone changing fonts, adding weird colors, using poor photographyor corrupting the layout.\n\nA static site can use Markdown files. That limits the user’s options; they make fewer mistakes and cannot adversely affect the pages. \n\n###  **7. Version Control and Testing**\n\nDatabase data is volatile. A CMS permits users to add, delete or change content on a whim. Wiping the whole site is a few clicks away. You can back up databases but, even if that’s done regularly, you’re still likely to lose some data.\n\nA static site is safe presuming your content is defined in Markdown files and you use a version control system such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Old files are retained, and changes can be undone quickly. Testing becomes easier because the site can be generated and previewed anywhere. \nPreview files are on a separate Git repository, as the live files which are on themain branch. \n\nSo all is good in the static site world. \n\nFor developers interested in our Boilerplate or Certification process.\n\n[BOILERPLATE](https://boilerplate.webriq.com/)\n\n[GETCERTIFIED.](http://webriq.com/get-certified)\n\n",

Add best practices like SSL, CDN distribution,and continuous deployment with a single click.\n\nAll elements of the platform are open sourced, so you are in full control of the website. The CMS interfaces with a Github repository through a simple User Interface, only containing the variable elements in the website, i.e. blogs, articles etc.\n\nEach new content entry triggers a new build on the platform and ensures that your content updates are reflected on your site within seconds. All automated, and without the need of a developer and without the possibility to change the code on your website by mistake. \n\nAll the content is safely stored in a Github public or private repository. You can revert to previous or go back later versions of the site by a single click. Last but not least you can assign different content editors to take of the content updates by inviting them as a team member.\n\nA full demo of the FREE CMS system is available at [DEMO](http://app.webriq.com/help/page/demo/howto).\nFollow the instructions and let us know if you need any additional help.\nRegister for an [ACCOUNT](http://app.webriq.com/auth/register).\n\n",

That way, you can COPE (\"create once, publish everywhere\").\nOffers webhooks that you can use to rebuild your static site in a fully automated fashion every time your content is modified.\n\nOn the not so positive site, the platforms are proprietary (as opposed to open source), do not come cheap, have a lot of complexity that more often not needed then needed and have a relatively high cost of ownership.\n\n## **A better alternative is a [FREE CMS](http://app.webriq.com/auth/register) for your static website**\n\nDeploy modern static websites with our automated open source platform. Add best practices like SSL, CDN distribution,and continuous deployment with a single click.\n\nAll elements of the platform are open sourced, so you are in full control of the website. The CMS interfaces with a Github repository through a simple User Interface, only containing the variable elements in the website, i.e. blogs, articles etc.\n\nEach new content entry triggers a new build on the platform and ensures that your content updates are reflected on your site within seconds. All automated, and without the need of a developer and without the possibility to change the code on your website by mistake. \n\nAll the content is safely stored in a Github public or private repository. You can revert to previous or go back later versions of the site by a single click. Last but not least you can assign different content editors to take of the content updates by inviting them as a team member.\n\nA full demo of the FREE CMS system is available at [DEMO](http://app.webriq.com/help/page/demo/howto).\nFollow the instructions and let us know if you need any additional help.\nRegister for an [ACCOUNT](http://app.webriq.com/auth/register).\n\n",

The same design concepts being utilized over and over again for the sake of keeping users happy: That’s good intent and sweet results for business owners, even if it means less conceptual diversity for designers and developers.\n\nNow, as far as online store designing goes, here are 5 trends you can expect will be followed by everyone in the year ahead:\n\n### 1. Card Layouts\n\n![Adidas Home page & Sony](  /img/uploads/addidas_sony.jpg)\n\nYou can thank Pinterest and every single template that used Masonry for this trend. Showing your products as Cards is something I can actively get behind, given its simplicity (of implementation) and users’ familiarity with the pattern.   \n\n### 2. A Different take on ‘Above the fold’\n\n![Above the fold](  /img/uploads/vimeo_duckfield_burberry.jpg  )\n\nWhile a lot of us may have realized that the fold is a myth, that doesn’t stop many retailers from cramming all they can on the top half for that first glance. Only, instead of cramming forms up there, we have decided to use ‘above the fold’ area for capturing attention.\n\nWith carefully clicked and picked Hero Images, Sliders, Background videos, etc.\n\nThe trend is a conversion-friendly trend and it is catching up with e-commerce portals fast.\n\n### 3. Material Design\n\nBy the end of 2013, we were at crossroads between flat and skeuomorphic design. We found the perfect solution in the form of Material design, and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. Everyone, including e-commerce stores, will be using the cleanliness and performance of flat with subtle enhancements of realistic design with abandon.\n\nHere are some stores who are doing it right:\n\n![ Storyville Coffee company & Blackberry](  /img/uploads/storyville-coffee-company_blackberry.jpg  )\n\n<center>![Pottermore](  /img/uploads/pottermore.png  )</center>\n\n#####  <center>**“Not an online store, but the perfect example anyway”**</center>\n\n### 4. Multi-channel done right \n\nAs the businesses change, so will the marketing trends and practices. 2017 is where multi-channel marketing and retail will truly take off as publishers and advertisers strive to create impactful, specifically targeted advertisements using advertiser data collected across multiple devices. This will help reduce advertising clutter on all devices.\n\nThis is to attract the tech-savvy millennials using a whole range of devices to shop. \n\nMarketers were doing it through ads (targeted with geo-location) so far, but Facebook began giving out [‘Place Tips’ to businesses](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/place-tips-for-businesses) to digitize real-life experiences (or vice versa? I am not a retailer).\n\nBasically: Even if Internet of Things hasn’t started to worry you yet, you should still prepare yourself to create more inclusive experiences as marketer and get ready to implement them as web developer and designer.\n\n### 5. Pop-Up Marketing\n\n![Popup Reebok Crossfit]( /img/uploads/popup-reebok-crossfit.jpg  )\n\n##### <center>\"Reebok does popups nicely.\"</center>\n \n![Popup Reebok Crossfit]( /img/uploads/popup-cyberchimps-is-confusing.jpg  )\n\n##### <center>\"Visual confusion, bad popup, but good trigger (activates once you've read the content).\"</center>\n\nGod this one is catching on _really_fast, to everyone’s general annoyance. Every single online store I’ve visited lately showed me a pop-up before I even got a look at the products. No, sellers, I will not subscribe or register my email address with you (Well, not now that I know how desperate you are anyway).\n\nPop-up/interruption marketing to increase social shares or generate leads is gaining traction. But I have to say, if you must do it, do it nicely. Make it trigger delayed (page leave, cursor movement, time delayed, etc.), make the transition smooth (not abrupt as if you’re saying ‘Boo!’). \n\nTry not to go for more than ONE popup per page; you can decide when to show it.\n\n### Bonus Takeaway\n\nThis is for the content people: Stock photos are dying out. Get ready to get creative with photography (Knolling, blur shots, anything else really), but make sure it’s your own so you get to get extra points for being a unique snowflake.\n\n### The Upshot\n\nI’m not a fortune-teller, but my belief that these ‘trends’ will persist in the coming year is backed by the current opinions in web designer community. \n\nYou’re free to treat these as hogwash.

Developers are forced to constantly fill out form fields, preview their work, and regularly patch CMS installations.\n\nIn an age where organizations are trying to innovate to be the best, “they’re facing a watershed moment in web development,” according to CMS provider Scrivito. \n\nThomas Witt, founder and CEO of Scrivito, explained ReactJS, which is developed by Facebook, was the first JavaScript framework that really worked well with what they needed it to do with their CMS solution. He said that since it is very component-based, developers can go in and build their own components and reuse them between projects, making it useful for digital agencies. That combined with the serverless approach of ReactJS makes it a very powerful framework. \n\nBy taking a serverless approach, ReactJS can be loaded onto a content delivery network and be rendered in the browser. Developers are able to access any backend server they want to with this serverless approach. \n\nThis is a big advantage in development because everything takes place in the browser, the company explained. Gone are the days of having to constantly preview what your code looks like. With a serverless approach, developers are able to see those changes instantly. This means that the “turnaround times for developers are much, much faster than they used to be before,” said Witt. \n\n“We think that ultimately everything is changing and we’re on the cusp of a new way of doing things and we want to take advantage of this technology and really push it to the limit and really try to make a product that speaks to everybody and does something for everybody, but really excels at security, scalability, and flexibility for editors, developers, and so forth,” said Douglas Patten, head of marketing at Scrivito. “We think that this combination of pretty much just working in React really is accepting into that and really pushing the boundaries of what’s possible right now. Things are going to change and we want to stay ahead of it.” \n\nIn terms of web app and web frontend development, Witt believes JavaScript “is simply the ultimate language and we think React is — at least at the moment — the ultimate framework.”\n\nTo address all of this, Scrivito announced today the first serverless JavaScript-based CMS. Scrivito is built on ReactJS and will improve the experience of building websites for web editors and developers. \n\n“We’re at a tipping point. Agencies and dev teams that stick with WordPress and the like are doomed to be overtaken by the inevitable shift to serverless computing and JavaScript development,” said Witt. “We built Scrivito to help agencies and companies meet the needs of today’s dynamic website requirements across any device or platform. And this is just the beginning.”\n\n# WebriQ CMS -- A Git-based approach to managing content\nThe premise is that you can leverage modern frontend tooling to create lighter, faster, more secure sites. And FYI, this isn't fringe developer extravaganza. Entire organizations like Smashing Magazine, Sequoia Capital & Mailchimp have migrated to frontend tooling. \nOne of the first implications here is decoupling the building & hosting of your site. You can \"pre-bake\" and pre-build assets and then serve them on Content Delivery Networks. This effectively frees your content from the database/templates imperatives of traditional CMS, like Wordpress and Drupal.\nHowever, the content itself still needs to live somewhere. That's where Github comes in.\nTo create your site, you can use a static site generator like Spike, the one implemented as standard by WebriQ or a Javascript frameworks like Ember, Angular, React, or Vue. It doesn't matter. The point is you store the site's content in a GitHub repository, where most of your pages can be simple Markdown files. Then, you deploy & host that static content on a content delivery delivery network of your choice. \nWebriQ CMS is a Git-based, open source Ember CMS. \n[The CMS is part of an APP](http://app.webriq.com) to build, manage, update and host sites build with unique front end tools. With WebriQ CMS your content lives in Github and the CMS leverages Github's API to interact directly with your content repository.

        "content": "\n The biggest downfall of headless systems is the fact that siloed systems don't share nicely PHOTO: Dane LowWith the rising buzz of headless CMS, comes the rising misunderstanding that CMS systems must fall into one of two categories: fully headless systems that require a from-scratch build for every new touchpoint, or page-based systems that are locked into desktop websites.\n\nThis, of course, just isn’t true. In fact, your options range across a whole scale of solutions, such as Experience-as-a-Service, where your CMS controls partial-page rendering, or Hybrid CMS, solutions that let you push your content to any channel — just as headless systems do — using a delivery tier that connects all those channels and shares data between them. Think of it as letting your experience work headless, without losing its brain.\n\n **Headless CMS Creates Siloed Islands\n-----------------------------------** If you think of your digital experience as an island — with visitor engagement onshore, and the pipelines of content and data running underneath — a headless system requires you to build a new bridge and intricate new data pipelines every time you want to add a new visitor channel, be it a microsite, mobile site, in-store display, intranet, etc.\n\nThis creates many siloed islands that don’t easily communicate with each other because each one requires individual maintenance and upkeep.\n\n\n\n **Hybrid CMS Builds a Connected Experience\n----------------------------------------** The freedom to experiment quickly with new customer touchpoints is imperative for innovative businesses, and so is the connectivity that lets a cross-channel experience share content, assets and data to create one consistent feel across the entire experience.\n\nThis is where Hybrid CMS solutions come into play. Instead of tediously creating multiple bridges for every new initiative, you just expand your island, thereby easily supporting new touchpoints that can directly share the content and data with your entire digital landscape.\n\n\n\n**Silos Are the Death of Personalization**\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe biggest downfall — and biggest risk — of headless systems is the fact that siloed systems such as touchpoints, teams, assets and third-party integrations, don’t share nicely. At a surface level, this can cause a fragmented customer journey, since the lack of shared assets across touchpoints causes each one to look and feel different. That’s because they aren’t updated in unison and often have different messaging.\n\nIt’s a broken experience, and it’s simply not competitive when it comes to serving today’s channel-agnostic customers.\n\nWhat’s more, under that metaphorical water, where all the data and content lie, these headless siloes are upsetting an even bigger beast — personalization. That’s because cross-channel personalization requires the constant communication of data between the touchpoints and third-party applications such as CRM and transactional platforms.\n\nThis is where personalization often comes to a staggering halt in purely headless scenarios.\n\n **True Flexibility Means Flexibility for All\n------------------------------------------** The reason headless is getting so much hype is its promised agility when adapting to new touchpoints. In reality, though, what often ends up happening is that businesses create many separate integration points that become difficult to maintain.\n\nThis makes it hard on the developers, who must constantly keep an eye on the functionalities and templates of every integration, as well as the marketers, who must recreate content for every separate touchpoint. Not to mention that, without a presentation layer and the preview option it provides, content displays often become shots in the dark, making for some risky publishing.\n\nStoring content independent from presentation is a great way to be open to experimentation with new channels, but if every update to these channels requires multiple rounds of back-and-forth between marketing and IT for every small change, you quickly lose the flexibility promised by headless solutions.\n\nThat’s why Hybrid CMS systems that keep content and presentation separate, but also have a cross-channel delivery tier built in, are so powerful. Content can be used in a format-neutral way that makes developers happy, but also supports content marketers who want to share assets cohesively across every channel.\n\n **If You Build the Software, You Become a Software Company\n--------------------------------------------------------** Companies jump into headless scenarios thinking, “Yes, this is great! We will build the delivery tier with the exact templates for the exact channels we want.” However, they quickly come to realize that if they are the ones building the software, they are also the ones maintaining it.\n\nThat means every bug fix, every update to customer demands or marketing needs, every API for new touchpoints — plus all the standard maintenance — becomes the responsibility of your development team, thereby burdening them with these tasks and turning them into maintainers of your delivery tier instead of innovators for your actual business.\n\nAnd along with that continual in-house maintenance, building your own system means your developers must take into account all of marketing’s requirements, too. Template creation and upkeep will now fall into the hands of your development team, so stop to consider that every small tweak marketing would like to make, even something as simple as changing font sizes or colors, will now need developer intervention.\n\nFor global companies, that ability to translate content easily will need to be built from the ground up. Additionally, for companies with multiple content contributors and editors, development needs will include creating workflows with the appropriate permissions.\n\n **Lose Your Head But Keep Your Sanity\n-----------------------------------** For businesses accustomed to rigid page-based CMS systems, it’s no surprise that headless solutions seem like a breath of fresh air — and they are. The freedom to publish content independent of presentation is vital to building exceptional experiences across channels, but it’s vital to keep in mind that this headless-style flexibility can be accomplished while keeping your brain and going hybrid. Hybrid systems keep your content flexible, but unlike purely headless systems, keep that content connected across channels.\n\nIn a world with an ever-increasing number of customer touchpoints and business technologies, the ability to share content, assets and data across channels is exactly how a CMS should work. That’s why businesses aiming to create engaging, personal experiences for their multi-device customers need a solution that offers the content flexibility of headless architecture, together with the data connectivity that puts cross-channel intelligence at the heart — and in the head — of the digital experience.\n\n Tjeerd Brenninkmeijer is the CMO of BloomReach EMEA.

        "content": "\nA Content Management System (CMS) as we know was created back when users browsed the internet using desktop browsers. And with the growing popularity of the internet came a content explosion. The monolithic CMS, as this is quite often called, seemed for a long time like the best way to handle content. But as technology shifted away from desktop and page-centric browsing to become more mobile, the CMS started to suffer from technical debt.\nOne way of trying to solve the problem, is adding an API to a monolithic CMS. This is a band-aid repair. The quick fix does nothing to repair the fundamental problem, which is the enormous underlying technical complexity of a CMS initially designed for a past area. Very often solving problems that are are no longer a problem when building content-rich websites and web applications. \n\n# What makes a CMS Headless\nIt is a kind of metaphor, whereby the presentation layer is the head and the content is the body. So if your CMS only handles the content, and not the presentation layer it is de facto headless. The CMS acts as a specialized database, with and interface that allows editors to create and nurture content, that can be used and re-used by all types of clients. It allows developers to build clients on basically any tool. The client connects to the CMS API, fetches the content it needs and the client takes care of the presentation layer.  \nMost pure play Headless CMS are 'cloud native'. They are only available as cloud services, not as software. Most of them are proprietary and behind some sort of paywall. The different packages you can choose from are very technical, non-transparent and do change quite often. A lot of these services start out with good FREE tiers, but are closing down on these FREE tiers as soon as they get some traction. The content-as-a-service approach simplifies scaling, monitoring, backups etc - while sacrificing flexibility and control. The idea behind Headless CMS pretty much scales down to avoiding coding in the CMS, and use an API instead - this combinations gets you off the block pretty fast, at least from the perspective of producing and delivering raw content. \n\n# The Headless CMS battlefield\n**[Contentful](https://contentful.com)** - Contentful is recognized as a pioneer in the Headless CMS industry. Contentful offers a matured REST API with a matching development kits for just about any language. Watch out for the pricing model as it can quickly become expensive for high traffic solutions.\n\n**[Sanity](http:/sanity.io/)** - A newcomer to the cloud-native Headless Space. The UI (Content Studio) is open sourced, and with that piece of software that you can self-host, you have a have a collaborative editing environment in React. The data is stored in real-time in a Hosted back-end and can be queried through GROQ (Graph Oriented Query Language) and soon GraphQL. \n\n**[Directus ](http://getdirectus.com)** - Open source, API-driven content management system, that can be self-hosted or hosted by Directus. \n\nand many more that are popping up every month, even week.\n\n# WebriQ - JAM Stack GLUE\nAt WebriQ, we have been developing and deploying JAM Stack websites for over two years now.

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\nA Content Management System (CMS) as we know was created back when users browsed the internet using desktop browsers. And with the growing popularity of the internet came a content explosion. The monolithic CMS, as this is quite often called, seemed for a long time like the best way to handle content. But as technology shifted away from desktop and page-centric browsing to become more mobile, the CMS started to suffer from technical debt.\nOne way of trying to solve the problem, is adding an API to a monolithic CMS. This is a band-aid repair. The quick fix does nothing to repair the fundamental problem, which is the enormous underlying technical complexity of a CMS initially designed for a past area. Very often solving problems that are are no longer a problem when building content-rich websites and web applications. \n\n# What makes a CMS Headless\nIt is a kind of metaphor, whereby the presentation layer is the head and the content is the body. So if your CMS only handles the content, and not the presentation layer it is de facto headless. The CMS acts as a specialized database, with and interface that allows editors to create and nurture content, that can be used and re-used by all types of clients. It allows developers to build clients on basically any tool. The client connects to the CMS API, fetches the content it needs and the client takes care of the presentation layer.  \nMost pure play Headless CMS are 'cloud native'. They are only available as cloud services, not as software. Most of them are proprietary and behind some sort of paywall. The different packages you can choose from are very technical, non-transparent and do change quite often. A lot of these services start out with good FREE tiers, but are closing down on these FREE tiers as soon as they get some traction. The content-as-a-service approach simplifies scaling, monitoring, backups etc - while sacrificing flexibility and control. The idea behind Headless CMS pretty much scales down to avoiding coding in the CMS, and use an API instead - this combinations gets you off the block pretty fast, at least from the perspective of producing and delivering raw content. \n\n# The Headless CMS battlefield\n**[Contentful](https://contentful.com)** - Contentful is recognized as a pioneer in the Headless CMS industry. Contentful offers a matured REST API with a matching development kits for just about any language. Watch out for the pricing model as it can quickly become expensive for high traffic solutions.\n\n**[Sanity](http:/sanity.io/)** - A newcomer to the cloud-native Headless Space. The UI (Content Studio) is open sourced, and with that piece of software that you can self-host, you have a have a collaborative editing environment in React. The data is stored in real-time in a Hosted back-end and can be queried through GROQ (Graph Oriented Query Language) and soon GraphQL. \n\n**[Directus ](http://getdirectus.com)** - Open source, API-driven content management system, that can be self-hosted or hosted by Directus. \n\nand many more that are popping up every month, even week.\n\n# WebriQ - JAM Stack GLUE\nAt WebriQ, we have been developing and deploying JAM Stack websites for over two years now. With a [dedicated APP](http://app.webriq.com), we have been able to build, develop, update and manage hunderds of sites.\nIn this model we are using a Static Site Generator to develop the site, a GIT based CMS system to update the content and a Github repository to store all HTML, CSS and Javascript files. GIT files are pushed to a CDN network. \nWhereas this model does fit well for most smaller projects, it has it's shortfalls when it comes to larger projects or projects with a need for frequent content updates and updates made by a variety of users, content writers and third party contributions \n\nSince the JAM Stack is more a concept then a real technology stack, we have been contemplating for a while how we could combine the best of the traditional LAMP Stack ideas and the serious advantages and benefits of the JAM Stack. It's what I would call the GLUE of the JAM Stack.\n\n# What are we gluing together\nA comprehensive Database (MongoDB) Service\nhttps://www.mongodb.com\n\nA Javascript (Node.js) API Content Management Framework\nhttps://strapi.io\n\nA State of the Art Static Site Generator\nhttps://www.gatsbyjs.org\n\nAn ultra-redundant global CDN\nhttps://www.netlify.com\n\n#### GET EARLY BIRD ACCESS TO[ WEBRIQ GLUE](http://webriq.us) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

When the world was just web and email, a web CMS could handle dynamic content delivery just fine.

In a monolithic, desktop and web only environment that is (rather was) the optimal solution.

Either the server answers the page immediately, exactly as it is stored, or the server generates it by executing code on demand.\nAlthough the Web was conceived as an entanglement of static files, server-side programming languages appeared very early and are now widely used. More than 80% of servers that use server-side language are running PHP. And hosting providers offering servers without dynamic language support are almost non-existent.\nYet, the dynamic generation of HTTP responses presents significant disadvantages in terms of web performance. A dynamic webpage is often built around a web server that loads an execution language that analyzes the HTTP request, often requests a database (sometimes located on another server in the datacenter) and third-party services, populates a logical model that reveals itself through an aggregate of templates to generate the HTML response. Quite logically so, response time is longer.\nA paradigm shift\nIf you want to deliver your static pages, you must have compiled them up front. This fact, as trivial as it may seem, changes everything. Indeed, compilation turns out to be the main advantage of static: shift the complexity from the Production environment to the integration process.\nIf your pages are served by a web server without being generated first, you have no need for a server-side language to be executed. As a consequence, many attack vectors disappear. You can’t steal confidential data by injecting malicious code if you have neither a database nor a server-side execution language.\nThe static trend allows you to completely transform the way a site is published.\n\n## How does the Jamstack work\n\nA static site generator (SSG) is a software executed locally or as a service that produces (and sometimes deploys) a static website using some data sources for model and configuration, and templates containing the business logic.\nThe SSG market is booming. Most of them generate a website from a set of files, often written with a lightweight syntax. The responsibility for the conversion to HTML is assigned to both a templating engine and a converter, responsible for transforming the markup into HTML. They are mainly a playground for front-end developers who know how they tick.\n\nIt becomes really interesting when you follow the lead of external data sources because then, we can talk about CMS that would not be used to render HTML, but only to store and expose data.

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\n## A bit of history\n\nWhen a user tries to access a web page, their browser makes a request to the server that hosts it. Either the server answers the page immediately, exactly as it is stored, or the server generates it by executing code on demand.\nAlthough the Web was conceived as an entanglement of static files, server-side programming languages appeared very early and are now widely used. More than 80% of servers that use server-side language are running PHP. And hosting providers offering servers without dynamic language support are almost non-existent.\nYet, the dynamic generation of HTTP responses presents significant disadvantages in terms of web performance. A dynamic webpage is often built around a web server that loads an execution language that analyzes the HTTP request, often requests a database (sometimes located on another server in the datacenter) and third-party services, populates a logical model that reveals itself through an aggregate of templates to generate the HTML response. Quite logically so, response time is longer.\nA paradigm shift\nIf you want to deliver your static pages, you must have compiled them up front. This fact, as trivial as it may seem, changes everything. Indeed, compilation turns out to be the main advantage of static: shift the complexity from the Production environment to the integration process.\nIf your pages are served by a web server without being generated first, you have no need for a server-side language to be executed. As a consequence, many attack vectors disappear. You can’t steal confidential data by injecting malicious code if you have neither a database nor a server-side execution language.\nThe static trend allows you to completely transform the way a site is published.\n\n## How does the Jamstack work\n\nA static site generator (SSG) is a software executed locally or as a service that produces (and sometimes deploys) a static website using some data sources for model and configuration, and templates containing the business logic.\nThe SSG market is booming. Most of them generate a website from a set of files, often written with a lightweight syntax. The responsibility for the conversion to HTML is assigned to both a templating engine and a converter, responsible for transforming the markup into HTML. They are mainly a playground for front-end developers who know how they tick.\n\nIt becomes really interesting when you follow the lead of external data sources because then, we can talk about CMS that would not be used to render HTML, but only to store and expose data. They are called Headless CMS.\n\nA headless CMS liberates the development team from the burden of maintaining a database, instead they can focus on the platform’s technical evolution and the assets pipeline while the contribution team can sharpen its content.\n\nEditors and content writers can work on files which are easy to store and modify. Their only common language with developers becomes the metadata passed in each file. Editors can use the editing tool or service of their choosing, even one that ensures collaboration. Editors also can benefit from source code versioning whenever they want to consult the history of their files, merge several versions or branch to write content they don’t want to publish right away.\n\nIn essence this means, that we are no longer in a system where the main metric of scalability is the number of simultaneous visitors, but in a system that can adapt to the frequency of generation and deployment requested by editors and content writers.\n\n**A headless CMS, a Static Site Generator and a deployment facility and you are ready to GO. **\n\nJAMStack is a real paradigm shift. The website being served to the visitor becomes, more than ever, a shell in which services, whether self-hosted or third parties, are dynamically injected. It is even possible to rely on several services for the same purpose and switch to a fallback if the main service is not available.\nAnd since you’re shifting a lot of the efforts to the Front End, why not go further and build your site with a Single Page App,  or transform it into a complete Progressive Web App (PWA), designed to be “mobile and offline first”?

Our tests on our own site are aimed at allowing us to assess the challenges facing site owners, to understand the scope of opportunity and potential for performance improvement, and also to explore the practical limitations in content management — one of the key criticisms of static site generation.\n\nOur site, QueryClick.com, was a small, fairly well-optimized B2B site, but it averaged ~6.99 second load time in the month prior to our deployment of static site generation (July 2016), dropping to ~1.8 seconds in the month following. That represented a load time reduction of 74.29 percent, despite some server response issues experienced during the period we were actively developing the site.\n\nOne month before and after switching to a static site generation infrastructure.\n\nWe performed further server optimization improvements over the year, reaching our sub-one-second mobile device target even while testing the impact of less efficient elements driven by JavaScript.\n\nYes, we know! We didn’t even use sprites, gzipping, or other such techniques — which highlights the impact of a platform-first approach to solving the page speed problem.\n\nA platform-first approach to page speed\n---------------------------------------\n\nI’ve written before about [the varying levels of importance of the different aspects of page speed](http://searchengineland.com/breaking-page-speed-events-seo-gain-195369) on SEO and about how Google’s algorithm employs data about SERP bounce-backs (when users bounce back to its SERPs after losing patience with a slow-loading site). But it’s worth making the point again as we head to a mobile-first world: server response times and the critical render path event (the point at which everything in the initial device viewport is rendered) are key to delivering high-performance SEO, _especially_ for enterprise-level sites.\n\nAny developer worth their salt will look at the asset load requests in QueryClick’s site displayed in the above image and shake their head at all the unoptimized elements. But that is the point. High performance was achieved _despite_ a lack of rigorous optimization in the code and asset deployment. It was driven by the platform and the high-level architecture decisions.\n\nGoogle would like us to improve further — and we will, but real performance change has already been delivered.\n\nSo, what architecture did we use? As Python and Django evangelists, we write the copy in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and push it to our staging server build via [Github](https://github.com/), where we can check to ensure it’s all OK. We then[](https://github.com/)use [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) to set a time for the staging server copy to be pushed to the live Git repository. Then, Cactus regenerates the pages and, voila, the live server is populated with the static pages.\n\nOf course, for your average content producer, this infrastructure is not as simple to create or maintain as a standard CMS without some technical know-how. That is the most common criticism of static site deployments, and many enterprise clients consider it a deal-breaker when they’re looking at static site solutions.\n\nCertainly, if you manage product inventory that dynamically changes by tens of thousand in a day, which one of our clients does, then a robust management back end is essential.\n\nThat’s why anyone deploying a static site performance solution in the enterprise must leverage [Oracle ATG](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24152_01/Platform.10-1/ATGMultiApp/html/s0102abouttheoracleatgwebcommerceplat01.html) or the like, which can easily generate and manipulate static web pages using its API. When you think about it, live dynamic site management requires significantly more hardware infrastructure than static.\n\nIf you need more convincing, take a look at the [variety of static code bases](https://www.staticgen.com/) already in flight. They use a variety of programming languages and many of them are fully capable of being fitted into an enterprise environment. When you also use a content delivery network [(CDN)](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/cdn/what-are-the-benefits-of-a-cdn.jsp) in production, you can offer a robust solution that delivers both blazing speed (for even poor 3G mobile connections) and total redundancy and elimination of server failure challenges.\n\nDynamic static asset provision and modern caching controls on static generators allow clean, live adjustment of content that is exactly comparable to dynamic site generation at a fraction of the hardware demand.\n\nIt may take years for the general web to catch up with Google’s pioneering push for modern, fast, easy-anywhere web experiences. But if you want to benefit your conversion rate and your brand experience, and enjoy a significant drive to SEO performance thanks to fast critical render performance and positive SERP bounce behavior, then you should have your development team investigate and find an architecture that works for your site today.\n\n- - - - - -\nDo the test yourselves by entering your domain on [TEST MY SITE](http://testmysite.io) or see the results for our [WebriQ Site](https://testmysite.io/599d2d62a700c415979468e6/www.webriq.com). \n\n## WebriQ CMS - a CMS for Static website deployments\n\n\nWith a Git-based CMS you can publish content every time you push changes to Git, allowing for a seamless development workflow. This approach is a bit difficult to scale with content that you want to publish across different platforms, but it will allow for you to have a purely static website. Since it runs on Git, you won’t have a problem finding an open source CMS to work with.\n\nWith an API-driven CMS, you’re creating content that will be strictly delivered via APIs. Although you won’t be able to keep track of content changes through Git, you’ll be able to scale your content through flexible APIs. But since you are working on a platform that hosts these APIs (server bandwidth ain’t cheap) these tend to not be open-sourced and rather pricey, but some offer freemium pricing models.\n\nOr use **[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com)**, which in essence can be an API driven Git-based CMS.\n\n- - - - - -\n\n### About The Author\n\n Chris Liversidge has over twelve years web development experience & is the founder of\n\n[QueryClick Search Marketing](http://uk.queryclick.com/), a UK agency specialising in SEO, PPC and Conversion Rate Optimisation strategies that deliver industry-leading ROI.\n\n   ",

        "content": "\n## Your website is overkill, and it’s killing your traffic.\n\nThere’s no reason to have a massive, unwieldy Content Management System with a database when you could have a fast, secure and beautiful static site. But how can you decide if a static site is right for you?\n\n###  1. YOU VALUE SECURITY\n\nWhen was the last time you updated your CMS software and plugins? By conservative estimate, [70% of all WordPress installs](https://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/wordpress-security-news-updates/statistics-70-percent-wordpress-installations-vulnerable/) are vulnerable to known security exploits. In 2014, [millions of Drupal sites](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/10/drupal-warns-every-drupal-7-website-was-compromised-unless-patched.html) were vulnerable due to a bug in the code, and [Drupal told users](https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003) that if they hadn’t updated within 7 hours of the announcement, they should assume that they were hacked. \n\nWith a static site, you don’t have to worry about malicious code being injected into your site when users visit it. Static sites are builton a production machine by static site generators, which take yourcode and spit out flat HTML files with CSS and JavaScript. When a user requests a page from your site, the server just sends them the file for that page, instead of building that page from various assets each time a viewer comes on . No build process means standard hacking attacks like scripting or database security exploits just don’t work.\n\n###  2. YOU VALUE SPEED\n\nWhat does a browser do? It renders HTML, CSS and JavaScript into a human-viewable format. No matter what type of site you use, a legacy dynamic site or a modern static one, what gets sent from the server to your browser is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So why take the time and resources to render your site every single time someone visits when you can have a pre-built version ready to go? There’s a reason that a normal static site hosted on a CDN is often 10 times faster time-to-first-byte than a site built with a legacy Content Management System.\n\nAdditionally, by hosting your static site on a CDN, you can serve it from whichever node is closest to your users. Someone viewing your site in a coffeeshop in Vienna pulls from a European server, not a server farm in Silicon Valley. The same goes for your Japanese visitors, or a user just down the street.\n\n###  3. FLEXIBILITY\n\nYour basic site built with WordPress or Drupal starts out as a one-size-fits-all solution that is then customized by bolting on plugins. A lot of plugins. Seriously, so many plugins. A quick Googlesearch for “must have WordPress plugins” yields a front page where nine of the ten posts list 20 plugins or more as “must have”.\n\nWitha static site, you can get lean and mean, with a tool that does exactly what you need it to. Make like the pros and use [Middleman](http://www.middlemanapp.com/) or [Roots](http://www.roots.cx/). At WebriQ we love to work with Roots as it build with a corporate client in mind.\n\n###  4. SMALLER FOOTPRINT\n\nYour WordPress install is a monster of cobbled together software and hardware, and probably looks something like this:\na machine running your preferred distro of Linux\na web server running Nginx or Apache\nPHP with its associated extensions and web server configurations\nMySQL\nWordPress or similar exercises like Joomla, Drupal, Concrete5 etc.\nAll the plugins you need \nYour theme and template code\nIf you don’t want to host your own, then you just have to hope that your host keeps its PHP and MySQL up to date, so that you aren’t exposed to those pesky security vulnerabilities that crop up everynow and again. Then there is the upkeep. Make sure you’ve allotted time to manage all these dependencies. And some more time in case an updated plugin or theme breaks something.\n\nA static site, when generated, is capable of being hosted on any webserver that can return HTML files. Of course, you’ll want to take advantage of the possibilities afforded to you with a static site by finding a host that allows for things like continuous deployment,instant cache invalidation, automated deploys and more. That job is done for you here at WebriQ without the need of having admin staff on board.\n\n###  5. RELIABILITY\n\nThe beauty of serving up flat HTML files is that they can be hosted anywhere and everywhere, like on a CDN. Let’s say there’s a DDoS attack on the server where your legacy site is hosted. Sorry, but you might just be down for a few hours or even days. That same attackhits a node where your static site is hosted? Your site just gets served up from the next node. Your visitors never notice that there’s a problem.\n\n###  6. VERSION CONTROL\n\nIt’s completely possible to design a site on your production machine and then upload it to a host , but the majority of developers would like some sort of version control system like Git. You can be roll back toearlier commits, meaning that short of deleting your online repository, you can always go back to a previous version of your site with a few keystrokes. And if you are a WebriQ customer, you can rollback to a previous deploy with just one click.\n\n###  7. DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE\n\nThe beauty of using a static website generator is in the developer experience. Build tools will output your HTML to a particular directory on your build machine, and nearly all tools include a local web server, which allows you to check and double check your progress as you go. You have the security of knowing that your site will look exactly the same to your visitors as it does to you as a developer.\n\n###  8. SCALABILITY\n\nYou’ve hit it big! Your site has gone viral, and you are seeing absolutely massive response and increased visits thanks to getting name checked across the social media spectrum. Did you anticipate that this might happen? Did you over provision massively, just in case this happened? Are you paying for huge chunks of bandwidth monthly, hoping for an explosion of traffic.\n\nOr are you making frantic calls to your service provider to get back up online after you made it to Reddit’s front page? Your plan couldn’t handle that kind of attention, and now you are down.\n\nAnd when your traffic means that you have to scale, it means that you are paying for all that complex code to run on your server at every page request. And that’s going to hit you right where it hurts the most.\n\nWith static, scalability is barely an issue. Of course it scales! Increased requests mean increased pages served, but no extra work in building those pages. With some providers, scale is built in, whilewith others like Amazon’s S3, all you have to pay for is the increased bandwidth.\n\n###  9. HOSTING &amp; PRICE\n\nI fall the heavy lifting of building a static site is done on your production machine, then what exactly is it that you are paying for with hosting? Asset storage, basically. Your static HTML files take up next to no space, and so your service is usually priced accordingly. Instead, you can spend your money where it really matters, on the features that make your site faster and your life easier, features like atomic deploys and asset fingerprinting to make sure your site is always globally consistent, or git integration andautomated builds, so your site is always up to date with your latest changes, and snapshot versioning and instant rollbacks.\n\nThere’s never been a better time to take advantage of the speed, security and reliability of static web generators and the development environment around them.

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\n## Your website is overkill, and it’s killing your traffic.\n\nThere’s no reason to have a massive, unwieldy Content Management System with a database when you could have a fast, secure and beautiful static site. But how can you decide if a static site is right for you?\n\n###  1. YOU VALUE SECURITY\n\nWhen was the last time you updated your CMS software and plugins? By conservative estimate, [70% of all WordPress installs](https://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/wordpress-security-news-updates/statistics-70-percent-wordpress-installations-vulnerable/) are vulnerable to known security exploits. In 2014, [millions of Drupal sites](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/10/drupal-warns-every-drupal-7-website-was-compromised-unless-patched.html) were vulnerable due to a bug in the code, and [Drupal told users](https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003) that if they hadn’t updated within 7 hours of the announcement, they should assume that they were hacked. \n\nWith a static site, you don’t have to worry about malicious code being injected into your site when users visit it. Static sites are builton a production machine by static site generators, which take yourcode and spit out flat HTML files with CSS and JavaScript. When a user requests a page from your site, the server just sends them the file for that page, instead of building that page from various assets each time a viewer comes on . No build process means standard hacking attacks like scripting or database security exploits just don’t work.\n\n###  2. YOU VALUE SPEED\n\nWhat does a browser do? It renders HTML, CSS and JavaScript into a human-viewable format. No matter what type of site you use, a legacy dynamic site or a modern static one, what gets sent from the server to your browser is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So why take the time and resources to render your site every single time someone visits when you can have a pre-built version ready to go? There’s a reason that a normal static site hosted on a CDN is often 10 times faster time-to-first-byte than a site built with a legacy Content Management System.\n\nAdditionally, by hosting your static site on a CDN, you can serve it from whichever node is closest to your users. Someone viewing your site in a coffeeshop in Vienna pulls from a European server, not a server farm in Silicon Valley. The same goes for your Japanese visitors, or a user just down the street.\n\n###  3. FLEXIBILITY\n\nYour basic site built with WordPress or Drupal starts out as a one-size-fits-all solution that is then customized by bolting on plugins. A lot of plugins. Seriously, so many plugins. A quick Googlesearch for “must have WordPress plugins” yields a front page where nine of the ten posts list 20 plugins or more as “must have”.\n\nWitha static site, you can get lean and mean, with a tool that does exactly what you need it to. Make like the pros and use [Middleman](http://www.middlemanapp.com/) or [Roots](http://www.roots.cx/). At WebriQ we love to work with Roots as it build with a corporate client in mind.\n\n###  4. SMALLER FOOTPRINT\n\nYour WordPress install is a monster of cobbled together software and hardware, and probably looks something like this:\na machine running your preferred distro of Linux\na web server running Nginx or Apache\nPHP with its associated extensions and web server configurations\nMySQL\nWordPress or similar exercises like Joomla, Drupal, Concrete5 etc.\nAll the plugins you need \nYour theme and template code\nIf you don’t want to host your own, then you just have to hope that your host keeps its PHP and MySQL up to date, so that you aren’t exposed to those pesky security vulnerabilities that crop up everynow and again. Then there is the upkeep. Make sure you’ve allotted time to manage all these dependencies. And some more time in case an updated plugin or theme breaks something.\n\nA static site, when generated, is capable of being hosted on any webserver that can return HTML files. Of course, you’ll want to take advantage of the possibilities afforded to you with a static site by finding a host that allows for things like continuous deployment,instant cache invalidation, automated deploys and more. That job is done for you here at WebriQ without the need of having admin staff on board.\n\n###  5. RELIABILITY\n\nThe beauty of serving up flat HTML files is that they can be hosted anywhere and everywhere, like on a CDN. Let’s say there’s a DDoS attack on the server where your legacy site is hosted. Sorry, but you might just be down for a few hours or even days. That same attackhits a node where your static site is hosted? Your site just gets served up from the next node. Your visitors never notice that there’s a problem.\n\n###  6. VERSION CONTROL\n\nIt’s completely possible to design a site on your production machine and then upload it to a host , but the majority of developers would like some sort of version control system like Git. You can be roll back toearlier commits, meaning that short of deleting your online repository, you can always go back to a previous version of your site with a few keystrokes. And if you are a WebriQ customer, you can rollback to a previous deploy with just one click.\n\n###  7. DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE\n\nThe beauty of using a static website generator is in the developer experience. Build tools will output your HTML to a particular directory on your build machine, and nearly all tools include a local web server, which allows you to check and double check your progress as you go. You have the security of knowing that your site will look exactly the same to your visitors as it does to you as a developer.\n\n###  8. SCALABILITY\n\nYou’ve hit it big!

        "content": "\nStacking web technologies is a common phenomenon adopted by developers since years to gain prominence in website development. One of the earliest web stacks formed with well-known open source technologies is LAMP STACK. LAMP is the combination of four important technologies – one is an operating system called Linux, second is the Apache web server, third being MySQL, the popular database system and last but not the least, Perl ( PHP or Python) the programming language used for developing HTML web pages. Every website requires a framework, a programming language, libraries and so on for its development. When you get the right combination of all these technologies you can surely develop a good website that can offer better performance. LAMP stack is a good but a conventional approach for website development that is now getting replaced by more modern approaches like the JAM Stack. \n\nThe term JAM Stack was coined by Netlify co-founder Mathias Biilmann to refer to the solution stack of JavaScript, APIs, and markup. JAM stack focuses on the front end build, eschewing server-side functions as much as possible. The three elements are:\nJavaScript: JAM stack JS resides on the client-side, handling responses and requests. Because this approach involves a style of build over specific technologies, the “J” in JAM stack can take many forms: pure JavaScript, a library like Vue.js, or even front-end frameworks like React.\nAPIs: Server-side processes and database commands are implemented vis API, which is accessed by JS-driven HTTP calls. JAM stack is API agnostic in that it simply does not care where yours comes from. You can use any of the bazillion pre-packaged APIs out there or custom-build your own.\nMarkup: This is the part users actually see when they access your site or app. These days there are all kinds of open source build tools (Grunt, Webpack, Gulp) — not to mention static site generators (Gatsby, Spike, Hugo) aggregating them into convenient platforms — to make creating templated markup stupid easy.\nOnce you’ve actually built that JAM stack-based opus, you, of course, want to place it at the very front edge of the internet event horizon. There are fantastic git-centric hosting services that allow continuous deployment — meaning that you can simply push your app, and any subsequent changes, to GitHub, and the service will automatically build the site from source and deploy it. This is essentially how GitHub Pages works. And, since JAM stack architecture also couples beautifully with high-availability, high-performance nature of content delivery network distribution, be sure to shop for a provider that gives good CDN.\n\n## JAM Stack is a Concept – Not a Library\nSo often, I speak to non-tech-savvy executives who ask me questions such as: “Will you use the JAMstack library?” Well, it isn’t a library, but a collection of tools tied together as a concept…\n\nIt’s important to know the difference because confusion about what it can or can’t do will influence the conversations you have with developers. Much like “Progressive Web Applications,” which was another set of guidelines but not a library, JAMstack isn’t any one set of code. Rather, it’s an approach to solving problems.\n\nThat is a big distinction versus, say, Node.js, which is a library. JAMstack can involve any number of different technologies or methodologies and still be within the realm of what the concept encompasses.\n\n## Tendency to move away from monolithic LAMP Stack CMS Systems\nDrupal , WordPress and SquarSpace are  traditionally “monolithic” CMSs, with presentation baked in via the theme. However, due to the need for more flexibility and freedom, many companies have begun decoupling the CMS, using it for content management, editorial, and administrative tools, while implementing a separate frontend component that communicates with the CMS via API.\nDecoupled CMS architecture (aka “headless”) is rising in popularity in the development world. This model allows breakthrough user experiences, gives developers great flexibility to innovate, and helps site owners future-proof their builds by allowing them to refresh the design without re-implementing the whole CMS. With all this upside, it’s no wonder this type of build has gained serious traction in the business community as of late.\n\n# WebriQ - JAM Stack GLUE\nAt WebriQ, we have been developing and deploying JAM Stack websites for over two years now. With a [dedicated APP](http://app.webriq.com), we have been able to build, develop, update and manage hunderds of sites.\nIn this model we are using a Static Site Generator to develop the site, a GIT based CMS system to update the content and a Github repository to store all HTML, CSS and Javascript files. GIT files are pushed to a CDN network. \nWhereas this model does fit well for most smaller projects, it has it's shortfalls when it comes to larger projects or projects with a need for frequent content updates and updates made by a variety of users, content writers and third party contributions \n\nSince the JAM Stack is more a concept then a real technology stack, we have been contemplating for a while how we could combine the best of the traditional LAMP Stack ideas and the serious advantages and benefits of the JAM Stack.

We migrated our content in to a repository on Github. In order to back into our Roots project, we used an extension: [roots-contentful](https://github.com/carrot/roots-contentful). Every time our website was compiled, roots-contentful would fetch data through Contentful's API and pass it into our view templates. It would also compile each individual blog post's HTML file using the [single page views](https://github.com/carrot/roots-contentful#single-entry-views) feature.\n\nWith the Roots project now built on top of data from Contentful, we then set about automating deployment when content changed. First, we created a webhook endpoint that would start a new build and deploy the project whenever it received a POST request. Then, we set up a webhook in Contentful with the new Netlify endpoint as the destination URL. With this in place, every time an editor creates, deletes, or edits a new piece of content, we receive a webhook from Contentful and kicks off a new deploy. We run Roots compile, loads the new Contentful data with roots-contentful, optimizes our assets, and finally pushes it out to a global CDN. Within a couple minutes from publishing, our new content is live on our static site. Pretty cool.\n\nThe next step in our process is to provide content managers and publishers with an online User Interface to update the content directly in to the Github repository. Each time the content is updated and committed to Github, a new build will be started and the new or updated content will be published on the Static site. \n\nWhilst designing a website is the work of a designer, and coding it work for a developer, with the above approach we give content managers and content managers the needed tools to update the content via a simple browser based User Interface. The User Interface contains only the content elements that you want to manage, nothing more and nothing less. So, if you only need to change your blog, the UI will only contain the elements to manage your blog. If you have a more complex data model, it can contain all content elements of your website that you want to manage. The beauty is that you are not touching any of the codes of your website, only the relevant content elements. \n\nBeyond security, reliability and scalability, the other big advantage of the Static approach is versioning of your website. Since your entire site, from configuration to content, is file- based, it is very easy to keep all aspects of it within a version control system like Git. This can be especially advantageous for things like documentation that you may want to allow community contributions, for example, using pull requests on GitHub repository.\n\nYou can see all the above in action on **[WebriQ APP](http://app.webriq.com/auth/register)** or you can send us a **[DEMO REQUEST](http://www.webriq.com/partners)**\n\n  ",

But as it turns out, the solution had already been created. In fact, it had been created even before CMSs like Joomla and WordPress had been invented! The answer is static websites, which are not generated by software on a server. Let's break it down. with something like WordPress, the CMS is acting as the intermediary between the server and the user; when you visit a WP site, the browser requests the page, WordPress pulls the information, such as text, images and whatnot from its database, then uses predefined layouts from themes, plugins etc...to generate workable webpage from all that information that is then sent to the browser.\nIn a static website, either the page is manually created, or generated using static-page-generation-tools. Either way, since the actual generation is done in advance, when your browser sends a request to the website's server, the only thing the server needs to do is send the pre-generated files to the browser, rather than running through the entire fetch-generate-send process.\nThis approach offers some pretty major benefits that directly answer the issues discussed earlier. For one, a static website hugely increases wetite security; many hacking attempts take advantage of exploits that allow them to 'inject' their own code into the CMS' or website's code, but in order to do this there needs to be actual code being run. In a static website everything is, as the name implies, static; no code is being run, only the generated website files are sent to the browser, making the site nigh-impossible to hack without gaining direct access to the server.\nSecondly, since a static website doesn't demand any additional operations to be run by a server, such as compressing PHP code or connecting to a database, to generate the final content it allows for significant improvement in load speed and optimization. Compare the speed of a fully-optimized dynamic website: .../smashingmagazine.com with its faster static counterpart: .../smashing-static.netlify.com\n\n# Solutions WebriQ CMS is bringing to the to the table\n### We have made a choice for you when it comes to Static Website Generators\n**Roots**\n\nRoots is very good at helping to build static front-ends. It is sponsored heavily by Carrot Creative, and makes frequent, highly variable builds quicker and easier for freelancers and agencies. It's a truly excellent framework for quickly and easily building small to medium sized front-ends of any kind.\nRoots can handle a huge number of compiled languages, and can be used with many tools that help push static sites as far as possible. For example, it can link with an API, pull in your data, and render parts of it into your views on compile. Then it can render the same or other views as javascript templates and you can push any other data from your API into them on the fly at runtime on the client side in reaction to user actions. And that's just a small taste of its capabilities. You really can do a lot with static sites, and roots is here to push those limits.\n\n***Why is WebriQ using Roots?***\n\nThe short answer is because roots was built very specifically for static site builds, so it's cleaner and better than general purpose build tools, since it's specialized to that purpose. The longer answer is that it's a qualitative thing. Much like people would ask \"Why should I use snapchat when I can just text a photo\" or \"Why should I use slack when I already have hipchat?\", there is no logical answer other than that the experience is different, and in my opinion, much better -- tailored exactly to what you need.

        "content": "\n Static Websites with Headless WordPress via REST API \n======================================================\n\nStatic websites are great but they still need some kind of content management system. And committing Markdown files to GitHub isn’t a friendly option for the majority of users including developers. So we end up using tools such as [Prose](http://prose.io/), [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) or [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) for the editing interface, user authentication and handling the media files.\n\nUsually it is only the WordPress PHP templating layer that bothers the proponents of static websites and is perceived as the performance bottleneck. However, we now have the [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) which is way more flexible than any collection of Markdown files.\n\nHow?\n----\n\n1. Use WordPress REST API during the build process to create the content source files with the necessary front-matter.\n2. Use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Assemble](http://assemble.io/) or any other build tool to actually construct the website.\n\nThere is even a [WordPress REST API client library for Node.js](https://github.com/WP-API/node-wpapi) which simplifies everything for Node based workflows and deployment setups.\n\nFinally, a free website on [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) can be used as a content library.\n\n# Solutions WebriQ CMS is bringing to the to the table\n### We have made a choice for you when it comes to Static Website Generators\n**Spike**\n\nSpike is very good at helping to build static front-ends. It is sponsored heavily by Carrot Creative, and makes frequent, highly variable builds quicker and easier for freelancers and agencies. It's a truly excellent framework for quickly and easily building small to medium sized front-ends of any kind.\nSpike is a next-generation static site generator. It is built on top of webpack, and a foundation of html, css, and js parsers that accept plugins to transform the output. It’s fast, actively developed, and very data-friendly. Check out the quick introduction video below to get a feel for Spike!\n[Video ](https://youtu.be/EGQjp_jgBps)\n\n\n***Why is WebriQ using Spike, and not Jekyll or Hugo?***\n\nThe short answer is because Spike was built very specifically for static site builds, so it's cleaner and better than general purpose build tools, since it's specialized to that purpose.

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\n Static Websites with Headless WordPress via REST API \n======================================================\n\nStatic websites are great but they still need some kind of content management system. And committing Markdown files to GitHub isn’t a friendly option for the majority of users including developers. So we end up using tools such as [Prose](http://prose.io/), [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) or [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) for the editing interface, user authentication and handling the media files.\n\nUsually it is only the WordPress PHP templating layer that bothers the proponents of static websites and is perceived as the performance bottleneck. However, we now have the [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) which is way more flexible than any collection of Markdown files.\n\nHow?\n----\n\n1. Use WordPress REST API during the build process to create the content source files with the necessary front-matter.\n2. Use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Assemble](http://assemble.io/) or any other build tool to actually construct the website.\n\nThere is even a [WordPress REST API client library for Node.js](https://github.com/WP-API/node-wpapi) which simplifies everything for Node based workflows and deployment setups.\n\nFinally, a free website on [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) can be used as a content library.\n\n# Solutions WebriQ CMS is bringing to the to the table\n### We have made a choice for you when it comes to Static Website Generators\n**Spike**\n\nSpike is very good at helping to build static front-ends. It is sponsored heavily by Carrot Creative, and makes frequent, highly variable builds quicker and easier for freelancers and agencies. It's a truly excellent framework for quickly and easily building small to medium sized front-ends of any kind.\nSpike is a next-generation static site generator. It is built on top of webpack, and a foundation of html, css, and js parsers that accept plugins to transform the output. It’s fast, actively developed, and very data-friendly. Check out the quick introduction video below to get a feel for Spike!\n[Video ](https://youtu.be/EGQjp_jgBps)\n\n\n***Why is WebriQ using Spike, and not Jekyll or Hugo?***\n\nThe short answer is because Spike was built very specifically for static site builds, so it's cleaner and better than general purpose build tools, since it's specialized to that purpose. The longer answer is that it's a qualitative thing. Much like people would ask \"Why should I use snapchat when I can just text a photo\" or \"Why should I use slack when I already have hipchat?\", there is no logical answer other than that the experience is different, and in my opinion, much better -- tailored exactly to what you need.

For example, if you build a website within your content management system, it’s not going to be easy to offer this content to native mobile apps or third-party content users. For most organizations, a single piece of content can be used across Web, mobile, tablet, social media and other connected smart devices, commonly known as the IoT (internet of things). Business users are looking to publish content updates and affect all sites and applications that use this content.\n\nTo solve this problem, many organizations are turning to systems that provide a \"headless CMS\" style of implementation.\n\nWith a headless CMS, the CMS is responsible for publishing content and media only; layout, presentation and front-end technology are the responsibility of the development teams that consume content and use as required. With the headless CMS, content is published that is available to any application via API data services. This is commonly known as content as a service (CaaS).\n\nThis sounds like a simple solution (and it is) to ensure content is available to any channel and that it is de-coupled from the design.\n\n### **There are a number of benefits to the headless CMS approach other than content de-coupling:**\n\n• The CMS implementation is cleaner. The CMS tool is purely storing content and isn’t cluttered with stuff that’s relevant to business users and other stuff that’s development only.\n\n• With little technical involvement required in the CMS, it’s also a lot quicker for business teams to create new functionality. For example, if a marketing department wishes to create a new series of product mini-sites, it can go straight into the CMS and start creating the content immediately without having to wait for developers to build CMS-based templates.\n\n• Companies no longer need large (and expensive) teams of specialist consultants who are knowledgeable in a particular CMS. Sure, some expertise is required, but not at the scale of a traditional CMS.\n\n• It provides a better software architecture. A headless CMS is typically architected so that the CMS platform and the published content are separated. There are a huge number of benefits to this, including:\n\n**Security**: Access to the CMS is restructured internally within the organization, while content that is published outside is either approved for public consumption or can be secured/encrypted as required.\n\n**Scalability**:      Need to add more servers to prop up demand for a particular application? Simply spin up a new app server and point it to the content.\n\n**Availability:** Should the CMS application go offline, there’s no impact on the web applications.\n\n**• Future-proof updates**. When it comes to re-branding one or more channels, there are literally no technical changes required within the CMS.\n\nTo summarize, a CMS is responsible for providing data storage, a user editing interface and a way to display and publish data, while a headless CMS provides a way to store and edit data but with a simple API to consume it without a specific way to publish such data.\n\nWhile we remain vendor agnostic, a number of CMS tools are really showing leadership in the headless CMS space.

        "content": "\nIn an ideal world, each company should have a custom made website with dynamically generated content backed by a CMS. It would be light-weight, deployed once per update, band updates by a tool that just does the updates, not everything. It would be rendered statically through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) just as your video streaming from Netflix or Hulu. \nHaving a Jam Stack website is fun and all, but how would a non-technical person edit content there? As always, there are multiple solutions available. \nA better approach would be to choose one of the many available CMS systems, that are suited to go with the Jam Stack.\n\n## API Driven CMS\nThe typical way to build a CMS-powered website is to choose a fully-integrated solution like WordPress and build your website as a collection of tightly embedded templates. Or if you want more control, you build your own integrated CMS using your preferred tech stack.\n\nAn API-based CMS, also known as a headless CMS, is a relatively new approach to content management with many advantages over the “old” way. API-based CMSs, such as Contentful, Directus, Strapi or Prismic, allow you to build websites and apps that are decoupled from their content management tools and integrated via API. This gives you the flexibility to build your front-end using your preferred tools (eg. Gatsby, Spike, React, Node, Angular) while being able to integrate a customized, robust CMS with ease. An API-based approach can save a team significant time and money in the initial implementation as well as ongoing maintenance.\n\nIn a nutshell, API-based CMS’s offer all the same editing capabilities of traditional CMS’s, but are significantly easier for developer to setup and maintain. This means your developers and content writers spend less time and money working on your CMS, and more time focusing on things important to your business.\n\nHere’s a table comparison:\n\n|                           | Traditional CMS                         | API Based CMS |\n| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| Setup       | Website must be built on top of CMS, requiring you to learn and build your website based on CMS rules and processes| Add CMS functionality where needed with just a couple of lines of code  |\n| Hosting     | Requires a database and specific server hosting     | Requires no database and no-hosting     |\n| Complexity     | Content, CMS code, and website code co-exist and intertwine to create complexity and interdependence      | Content exists separately and is rendered within website codebase via simple API calls.    |\n| Flexibility     | Website must be built in a specific programming language or framework.    | Integrates with any codebase.   |\n| Maintenance            | Security upgrades, database backups, etc.   | None    |\n\n\n\nThe biggest advantage in my eyes while using API Driven CMS is to not have to care about a CMS at all. It should provide data, give your user the ability to edit their Website/App/Content easily in any way - and maybe (only maybe) provide some automation like image optimization, plugins or/and localization to make life easier and more efficient. \n\nThis API Driven approach is used by [WebriQ GLUE](http://webriq.us). It’s a CMS that allows you to create an API for your website, without coding. It doesn’t require a static site generator to work. With this approach, we will have to send asynchronous requests to our API on each website visit, to always serve fresh content. WebriQ GLUE is gluing together the entire workflow of dynamic content updates, and rebuilding the site each time an update occurs -- the site is statically rendered and served uniquely to each individual viewer through a content delivery network. Totally safe and secure.\n\n## Git-Based CMS \nA GIT based CMS solves common version control and integration challenges of the JAM Stack by delivering a natural authoring experience on top of GIT for non-technical content writers. \nIn a nutshell, GIT based CMS systems are typically open source content management system for your Git workflow that enables you to provide editors with a friendly UI and intuitive workflows. You can use it with any static site generator to create faster, more flexible web projects. Content is stored in your Git repository alongside your code for easier versioning, multi-channel publishing, and the option to handle content updates directly in Git.\n\nThe core advantages are;\n\nFast, web-based UI: With rich-text editing, real-time preview, and drag-and-drop media uploads.\nPlatform agnostic: Works with most static site generators.\nEasy installation: Add two files to your site and hook up the backend by including those files in your build process or linking to a Content Delivery Network (CDN).\nModern authentication: Using GitHub, and JSON web tokens.\nFlexible content types: Specify an unlimited number of content types with custom fields.\nFully extensible: Create custom-styled previews, UI widgets, and editor plugins.\n\nThe GIT based concept is used by [WebriQ goes Mad](http://webriq.services). This CMS work as a Graphical User Interface for GIT. You can write posts through an admin panel, and under the hood, after saving, the CMS will commit your post to the code repository, and trigger a re-deploy of your website. A Git based CMS is simpler to set-up, update and maintain and is the preferred solution for companies that have no or little in-house content management resources. \n\nAn outdated website can dramatically decrease conversions. Retro, cluttered designs distract visitors from the conversion point; lack of modern upgrades can make a client lose faith in your business. You may not need all latest trends mentioned. But what you must have is a super fast, secured, reliable and scalable website that is designed for Mobile Browsers First and that can work offline in poorly covered areas . \nThe choice between hiring a web agencies or an individual developer comes down to budget $$$$. Again in an ideal world you would hire a web agencies for all design and marketing aspects and a talented individual developer that is up to date with the latest web development techniques. Beyond the cost will be the time you as a busy entrepreneur will have to spent on gluing the project together to a workable day-to-day solution. \n\nA potential middle ground is [WebriQ goes Mad](https://requestforquote.webriq.services/), with its pioneering Web Design as a Service Concept (WDaaS). WDaaS provides a fundamental change in the service of web design. With WDaaS businesses can create stunning websites, landing pages, and sales funnels, without the labor and frustrations of Do-It-Yourselves tools nor the expense of a marketing agency. So you get the services of a web agency and a developer at the cost of the developer. \n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/281370558\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/281370558\">This Is WebriQ Goes Mad</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user87627294\">Alex Belding</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It would be rendered statically through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) just as your video streaming from Netflix or Hulu. \nHaving a Jam Stack website is fun and all, but how would a non-technical person edit content there? As always, there are multiple solutions available. \nA better approach would be to choose one of the many available CMS systems, that are suited to go with the Jam Stack.\n\n## API Driven CMS\nThe typical way to build a CMS-powered website is to choose a fully-integrated solution like WordPress and build your website as a collection of tightly embedded templates. Or if you want more control, you build your own integrated CMS using your preferred tech stack.\n\nAn API-based CMS, also known as a headless CMS, is a relatively new approach to content management with many advantages over the “old” way. API-based CMSs, such as Contentful, Directus, Strapi or Prismic, allow you to build websites and apps that are decoupled from their content management tools and integrated via API. This gives you the flexibility to build your front-end using your preferred tools (eg. Gatsby, Spike, React, Node, Angular) while being able to integrate a customized, robust CMS with ease. An API-based approach can save a team significant time and money in the initial implementation as well as ongoing maintenance.\n\nIn a nutshell, API-based CMS’s offer all the same editing capabilities of traditional CMS’s, but are significantly easier for developer to setup and maintain. This means your developers and content writers spend less time and money working on your CMS, and more time focusing on things important to your business.\n\nHere’s a table comparison:\n\n|                           | Traditional CMS                         | API Based CMS |\n| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| Setup       | Website must be built on top of CMS, requiring you to learn and build your website based on CMS rules and processes| Add CMS functionality where needed with just a couple of lines of code  |\n| Hosting     | Requires a database and specific server hosting     | Requires no database and no-hosting     |\n| Complexity     | Content, CMS code, and website code co-exist and intertwine to create complexity and interdependence      | Content exists separately and is rendered within website codebase via simple API calls.    |\n| Flexibility     | Website must be built in a specific programming language or framework.    | Integrates with any codebase.   |\n| Maintenance            | Security upgrades, database backups, etc.   | None    |\n\n\n\nThe biggest advantage in my eyes while using API Driven CMS is to not have to care about a CMS at all. It should provide data, give your user the ability to edit their Website/App/Content easily in any way - and maybe (only maybe) provide some automation like image optimization, plugins or/and localization to make life easier and more efficient. \n\nThis API Driven approach is used by [WebriQ GLUE](http://webriq.us). It’s a CMS that allows you to create an API for your website, without coding. It doesn’t require a static site generator to work. With this approach, we will have to send asynchronous requests to our API on each website visit, to always serve fresh content. WebriQ GLUE is gluing together the entire workflow of dynamic content updates, and rebuilding the site each time an update occurs -- the site is statically rendered and served uniquely to each individual viewer through a content delivery network. Totally safe and secure.\n\n## Git-Based CMS \nA GIT based CMS solves common version control and integration challenges of the JAM Stack by delivering a natural authoring experience on top of GIT for non-technical content writers. \nIn a nutshell, GIT based CMS systems are typically open source content management system for your Git workflow that enables you to provide editors with a friendly UI and intuitive workflows. You can use it with any static site generator to create faster, more flexible web projects. Content is stored in your Git repository alongside your code for easier versioning, multi-channel publishing, and the option to handle content updates directly in Git.\n\nThe core advantages are;\n\nFast, web-based UI: With rich-text editing, real-time preview, and drag-and-drop media uploads.\nPlatform agnostic: Works with most static site generators.\nEasy installation: Add two files to your site and hook up the backend by including those files in your build process or linking to a Content Delivery Network (CDN).\nModern authentication: Using GitHub, and JSON web tokens.\nFlexible content types: Specify an unlimited number of content types with custom fields.\nFully extensible: Create custom-styled previews, UI widgets, and editor plugins.\n\nThe GIT based concept is used by [WebriQ goes Mad](http://webriq.services). This CMS work as a Graphical User Interface for GIT. You can write posts through an admin panel, and under the hood, after saving, the CMS will commit your post to the code repository, and trigger a re-deploy of your website. A Git based CMS is simpler to set-up, update and maintain and is the preferred solution for companies that have no or little in-house content management resources. \n\nAn outdated website can dramatically decrease conversions. Retro, cluttered designs distract visitors from the conversion point; lack of modern upgrades can make a client lose faith in your business. You may not need all latest trends mentioned. But what you must have is a super fast, secured, reliable and scalable website that is designed for Mobile Browsers First and that can work offline in poorly covered areas . \nThe choice between hiring a web agencies or an individual developer comes down to budget $$$$. Again in an ideal world you would hire a web agencies for all design and marketing aspects and a talented individual developer that is up to date with the latest web development techniques. Beyond the cost will be the time you as a busy entrepreneur will have to spent on gluing the project together to a workable day-to-day solution. \n\nA potential middle ground is [WebriQ goes Mad](https://requestforquote.webriq.services/), with its pioneering Web Design as a Service Concept (WDaaS). WDaaS provides a fundamental change in the service of web design. With WDaaS businesses can create stunning websites, landing pages, and sales funnels, without the labor and frustrations of Do-It-Yourselves tools nor the expense of a marketing agency. So you get the services of a web agency and a developer at the cost of the developer. \n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/281370558\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/281370558\">This Is WebriQ Goes Mad</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user87627294\">Alex Belding</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Check out the infographic below to learn more about how open source software has changed the way people build websites.\n\nUsing the traditional monolitic approach whereby you build, manage and publish your website on a single server, there is a more distributed approach whereby you build your site on a Static Site Generator, publish the site on GIT repositories and host the site on a Content Delivery Network.\n\n**Choosing between a Git-based CMS or an API-driven CMS**\n\nWith a Git-based CMS you can publish content every time you push changes to Git, allowing for a seamless development workflow. This approach is a bit difficult to scale with content that you want to publish across different platforms, but it will allow for you to have a purely static website. Since it runs on Git, you won’t have a problem finding an open source CMS to work with.\n\nWith an API-driven CMS, you’re creating content that will be strictly delivered via APIs. Although you won’t be able to keep track of content changes through Git, you’ll be able to scale your content through flexible APIs. But since you are working on a platform that hosts these APIs (server bandwidth ain’t cheap) these tend to not be open-sourced and rather pricey, but some offer freemium pricing models.\n\nOr use **[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com)**, which in essence can be an API driven Git-based CMS. \n\nExciting times for all front-end developers and for business owners who want to simplify their web operations with secure, reliable and ultra fast technologies. \n\n> Get the White Paper, “[The Benefits of Open Source Software](http://www.copypress.com/benefits-open-source-software-whitepaper/)” from our friends at CopyPress.\n\n[](https://www.pixelproductionsinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Open-Source-IG.png)\n\n\n\n  ",

Check out the infographic below to learn more about how open source software has changed the way people build websites.\n\nUsing the traditional monolitic approach whereby you build, manage and publish your website on a single server, there is a more distributed approach whereby you build your site on a Static Site Generator, publish the site on GIT repositories and host the site on a Content Delivery Network.\n\n**Choosing between a Git-based CMS or an API-driven CMS**\n\nWith a Git-based CMS you can publish content every time you push changes to Git, allowing for a seamless development workflow. This approach is a bit difficult to scale with content that you want to publish across different platforms, but it will allow for you to have a purely static website. Since it runs on Git, you won’t have a problem finding an open source CMS to work with.\n\nWith an API-driven CMS, you’re creating content that will be strictly delivered via APIs. Although you won’t be able to keep track of content changes through Git, you’ll be able to scale your content through flexible APIs. But since you are working on a platform that hosts these APIs (server bandwidth ain’t cheap) these tend to not be open-sourced and rather pricey, but some offer freemium pricing models.\n\nOr use **[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com)**, which in essence can be an API driven Git-based CMS. \n\nExciting times for all front-end developers and for business owners who want to simplify their web operations with secure, reliable and ultra fast technologies. \n\n> Get the White Paper, “[The Benefits of Open Source Software](http://www.copypress.com/benefits-open-source-software-whitepaper/)” from our friends at CopyPress.\n\n[](https://www.pixelproductionsinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Open-Source-IG.png)\n\n\n\n  ",

It’s time to use headless content management technologies. This approach allows content creators and front end developers to use their own independent languages, tools, and workflows, rather than relying on a standard CMS or eCommerce platform. Content is simply delivered in a machine readable format called [JSON](https://www.copterlabs.com/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/). Designers and developers then gain a lot more freedom to use content wherever and whenever it makes sense.\n\n#### That sounds like boring gibberish. Why should I care about this?\n\nBecause traditional CMSes or eCommerce solutions allow you to rock this:\n\nWowee. Not bad, but…You could be rocking this:\n\nThis is an actual Augmented Reality app from the British Museum. They use Contentful to do this. See the [case study](https://www.contentful.com/case-studies/british-museum/). By going headless, you can instantly ship and edit content into _any_ app your developers can build. Content can be served at a specific location, and across multiple devices at the same time.\n\nA headless CMS assumes nothing about the destination of your content, which is why it is much smarter for the modern web. Developers can integrate content across multiple applications at the same time. Developers can use your content in any way, at a much bigger scale, and in any device. A/B or multivariate test. Personalize content for users using advanced AI. Customize digital displays. Heck, pull content from another API, structure it, and ship it on your digital properties. If developers can build it, you’ll have a centralized dashboard to ship content to it.\n\nEdit content that is then served on a static page. Edit voice interfaces. Edit a digital display on a flying drone that is carrying tacos. Whatevs.I don’t think that we as marketers recognize the capabilities that are already out there. We haven’t even built many digital teams who can accommodate this shift. Yet.\n\nYep. You wouldn’t force your homebuilder to use a single material for your house. Why are we forcing developers to use PHP or Java for our projects? Why must they stick with MySQL when they can launch databases that handle many more concurrent reads and writes, even in a graph? Just like the materials that build skyscrapers and homes, different programming languages, databases, and developer tools excel at different tasks.\n\nThis is how many developers see your CMS’s technology. Courtesy of [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-php-singularity/)\n\n#### **A decoupled approach makes more sense**\n\nDevelopers aren’t building these experiences very often because marketers are not asking for them. We’re sticking to our traditional way of doing our jobs. Most traffic is mobile, and there are [more connected devices than human beings](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/there-are-officially-more-mobile-devices-than-people-in-the-world-9780518.html). What’s holding us up? Why can’t we customize that kind of content too?\n\n#### So what’s the state of headless solutions?\n\nThe technology is there. It’s up to us to start using it.\n\nCurrently you can use WordPress’s new lightweight version, dubbed [“Calypso,”](https://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/) on [WordPress.com](https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/). Any developer can use [their API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) though. Here’s a blog post that explains how to go [headless with WordPress using React](https://medium.com/@jchiatt/headless-wordpress-with-react-d573bca02ee0).\n\nThere are a variety of other Headless CMSes, including [Kentico](https://www.kentico.com/), [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) (built on top of the popular GraphQL project), [Contentstack](https://www.contentstack.com/), [Canner](https://www.canner.io/), [Prismic](https://prismic.io/), and others.\n\n[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) offers [“content infrastructure.”](https://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/content-as-a-service/) Their API goes beyond the traditional page-centric approach to content, hence, they do not consider themselves a CMS. Contentful may seem complex at first, but it is excellent for using content across various channels.\n\nBy leveraging [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com), a frontend developers can easily deploy and scale stacks in all sorts of languages.\n\n#### WebriQ is offering you a GIT Based CMS system with a Complete User Interface\n\n**[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com)** is bridging the GAP between Static Site Generators and Flat File CMS Systems. \nThe days when a brand only needed one website to house its online presence are long gone. Today, webinars, events, pop-up shops and product promotions all require their own microsites or landing pages. \nWhen we moved into what some call the post-CMS landscape, the usage of static site generators and Flat-file CMS and Static Site Generator functionality overlaps in many ways ; so how do you choose between the two? \n\nWhen we moved into what some call the [post-CMS landscape](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/), the usage of static site generators (SSGs) and flat-file CMS for these microsites (and at times for lightweight corporate sites), grew. And now, with the headless CMS hype in full flow, the interest in these front-end solutions is returning.\n\nAfter listing the [best flat-file CMS](http://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/15-flat-file-cms-options-for-lean-website-building/) and the [best static site generators](http://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/15-static-site-generators-to-complement-your-headless-cms/) on offer — it’s time to formally identify what separates these two similar technologies.\n\nThe rise of the headless CMS approach and the benefits it provides for users, developers and operations mean it’s only going to become the default way to implement true multichannel, multibrand applications going forward.\n\n#### It’s time for content creators and developers to get out of each other’s way. Now we can.\n\nThe web has fundamentally changed since the CMS first came out. Just as we moved from building websites in Dreamweaver to the CMS, it’s time that we move past traditional CMS thinking. The web will ultimately be a lot more interesting.\n\nDo not try and bend the CMS. That’s impossible. Instead only try to realize the truth. There is no CMS.",

What’s holding us up? Why can’t we customize that kind of content too?\n\n#### So what’s the state of headless solutions?\n\nThe technology is there. It’s up to us to start using it.\n\nCurrently you can use WordPress’s new lightweight version, dubbed [“Calypso,”](https://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/) on [WordPress.com](https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/). Any developer can use [their API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) though. Here’s a blog post that explains how to go [headless with WordPress using React](https://medium.com/@jchiatt/headless-wordpress-with-react-d573bca02ee0).\n\nThere are a variety of other Headless CMSes, including [Kentico](https://www.kentico.com/), [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) (built on top of the popular GraphQL project), [Contentstack](https://www.contentstack.com/), [Canner](https://www.canner.io/), [Prismic](https://prismic.io/), and others.\n\n[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) offers [“content infrastructure.”](https://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/content-as-a-service/) Their API goes beyond the traditional page-centric approach to content, hence, they do not consider themselves a CMS. Contentful may seem complex at first, but it is excellent for using content across various channels.\n\nBy leveraging [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com), a frontend developers can easily deploy and scale stacks in all sorts of languages.\n\n#### WebriQ is offering you a GIT Based CMS system with a Complete User Interface\n\n**[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com)** is bridging the GAP between Static Site Generators and Flat File CMS Systems. \nThe days when a brand only needed one website to house its online presence are long gone. Today, webinars, events, pop-up shops and product promotions all require their own microsites or landing pages. \nWhen we moved into what some call the post-CMS landscape, the usage of static site generators and Flat-file CMS and Static Site Generator functionality overlaps in many ways ; so how do you choose between the two? \n\nWhen we moved into what some call the [post-CMS landscape](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/), the usage of static site generators (SSGs) and flat-file CMS for these microsites (and at times for lightweight corporate sites), grew. And now, with the headless CMS hype in full flow, the interest in these front-end solutions is returning.\n\nAfter listing the [best flat-file CMS](http://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/15-flat-file-cms-options-for-lean-website-building/) and the [best static site generators](http://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/15-static-site-generators-to-complement-your-headless-cms/) on offer — it’s time to formally identify what separates these two similar technologies.\n\nThe rise of the headless CMS approach and the benefits it provides for users, developers and operations mean it’s only going to become the default way to implement true multichannel, multibrand applications going forward.\n\n#### It’s time for content creators and developers to get out of each other’s way. Now we can.\n\nThe web has fundamentally changed since the CMS first came out. Just as we moved from building websites in Dreamweaver to the CMS, it’s time that we move past traditional CMS thinking. The web will ultimately be a lot more interesting.\n\nDo not try and bend the CMS. That’s impossible. Instead only try to realize the truth. There is no CMS.",

        "content": "\nYou are most likely familiar with Wordpress to build a website. Wordpress is using what is called in technical terms the LAMP Stack. Static websites are using the JAM Stack. \nJAM Stack stands for JavaScript, APIs, & Markup; it’s an approach to building websites that allows you to have all the web performance and security benefits of a static website along with the dynamic capabilities of a database-driven CMS.\n\n## **Problems dynamic websites build with f.ex. Wordpress are facing**\nLet’s start with web performance. Regardless of how well we optimize everything or how good of a job we do with with perceived performance, dynamic websites are SLOW. This is due to the amount of steps that have to take place in order to display the requested content everytime someone visits a web page.\nWe’re also at a point where every website being built on Wordpress  is being overwhelmingly loaded with plugins, scripts, and a ton of other overhead that just slows the crap out of what we ship to production. This is in addition to security concerns, expensive hosting, and the ever-changing landscape of different languages a developer must learn to build a website.\nSo let’s rethink our approach to building dynamic websites and start from scratch static.\n\n## **How Static Websites Differ**\nFirst, what’s a static website? Nope, not a new technology, static websites have been around for ages. That Dreamweaver website you created back in college? That’s a static website. A website made up of HTML pages with pre-populated content.\nWhen a browser requests the URL of a static page, the server returns the static page in it’s entirety. There aren’t calls to a database being made nor content being generated on the fly — the content is already there.\nThat doesn’t mean we’re putting together every page by hand . There are different tools that address different layers of this technology stack. \n\n**Faster loading times**\n\nThe fact that JAMstack websites don’t have to make any calls to a database makes the loading time exponentially quicker.\nMatt Biilmann, founder of Netlify, ran a test of the Smashing Magazine website (which currently runs on WordPress) against a static counterpart he cloned and deployed on Netlify. It resulted in a website that loaded six times faster than the original.\n\n**Solid Security**\n\nIf you’re using a popular CMS, you know about the necessary security measures. This is mostly due to the login page being available to anyone with access to the website and some basic knowledge of the specific CMS. With a static website, a login page doesn’t exist.\nIf you do integrate a headless CMS (more on what a headless CMS is further down) to your static website, tracking the website back to its CMS isn’t as straightforward as it is with a traditional CMS.\n\n**Front-End and CMS are Decoupled**\n\nYou don’t have a CMS dictating the way you should structure your content and pages. Not having a CMS tied in to the presentation layer gives you the flexibility of creating anything you want on the front-end while using the API endpoints to pull in content.\n\n**Lower cost of scaling**\n\nWe’re not dealing with expensive runtimes or complicated server setups — we’re only dealing with static files being served on the client side. For smaller sites, you can get away with cheap hosting as long as you pair it with a fast CDN.\n\n**Seamless developer experience**\n\nFrom the developer’s perspective, the JAMstack methodology doesn’t require us to learn a different backend language to build a data-driven website. We’re able to build on our foundation of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build complex websites.\n\n## What Steps to take to take to build your Static Website\n\n### Step 1: Choose a Host & CDN\nThe beauty of static websites is that you’re able to host them anywhere. ANYWHERE.\nYou don’t need a list of server requirements with a certain version of PHP or a specific database. All you need is a host that allows you serve HTML, CSS, and JS for a straightforward development workflow, especially when dealing with staging environments.\nI recently started playing around with the idea of moving to Amazon Web Services. I zipped up my website, uploaded it to their server, and boom, my website was ready to go live by just pointing the DNS. Because my website is static, I didn’t have to worry about transferring a database or server requirements. (It took me about 10 minutes to set this up.)\nAlthough you are going to enjoy the flexibility (and affordability) of hosting, specially with larger scale websites, you want to make sure that you’re using a host with a fast CDN to deliver your static files. You have a bunch of options:\n\n**Netlify**\n\nBuilt from the ground up to host modern static websites, Netlify (they actually coined the term “JAMstack”) understands the static concept and provide a full suite of open source products that are focused around static websites (sorta like the WP Engine of static websites). They’re also the hosting platform behind the new redesign of Smashing Magazine. Plans are relatively affordable but if you have an open source project, they’ll host it for free.\n\n**Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3**\n\nAmazon S3 is a utility storage service that’s used for backups and content storage as well as static websites. This is an ideal hosting setup for a JAMstack website. If it’s your first time creating an AWS account, they’ll provide free hosting for the first 12 months.\n\n**WebriQ**\n\nUsing the full capabilities of the Netlify network, WebriQ provides you with a fully self-contained Software-as-a-Service for building and managing your Static Websites. Building tools, content management tools, continuous deployment through Github, SSL certificates are just a couple of important features that come standard with any service. Pricing is quite affordable and starts at $15 per month for a fully managed service. Free service is available at [WEBRIQ APP](http://app.webriq.com)\n\n### Step 2: Decide on a Static Site Generator\nIn order to avoid creating static html pages manually, you’re going to need a sturdy static site generator.\nThere are 457 static site generators to choose from. But I’ll help you narrow down the list to the top three contenders below.\n\n**Jekyll**\n\nBuilt on Ruby and using Liquid as a templating engine; Jekyll was created eight years ago when Github founder, Tom Preston-Werner, was looking to write his own blogging engine. A very well documented SSG with the support of a massive community. It has been the de facto choice for static site generators since static websites began regaining popularity around four to five years ago.\nAlthough Jekyll is simple to setup, the workflow begins slow down when working on larger websites; static pages will still load fast once on the server, but the time for them to get generated locally during development starts becoming painful.\n\n**Hugo**\n\nBuilt on GoLang using it’s own templating engine; Hugo was created in 2013 by Steve Francia, Docker’s Chief Operator. Although relatively young, Hugo has the support of Smashing Magazine and its immense community; Smashing Magazine announced that they would be ditching WordPress for Hugo in the new iteration of their website. The main reason for choosing Hugo as their SSG was the speed in which Hugo generates its pages. This was something that co-founder, Vitaly Friedman, needed to carefully take into consideration for the large number of posts the website has published since 2006.\n\n**Roots**\n\nRoots is very good at helping to build static front-ends. It is sponsored heavily by Carrot Creative, and makes frequent, highly variable builds quicker and easier for freelancers and agencies. It's a truly excellent framework for quickly and easily building small to medium sized front-ends of any kind.\nRoots can handle a huge number of compiled languages, and can be used with many tools that help push static sites as far as possible. For example, it can link with an API, pull in your data, and render parts of it into your views on compile. Then it can render the same or other views as javascript templates and you can push any other data from your API into them on the fly at runtime on the client side in reaction to user actions. And that's just a small taste of its capabilities. You really can do a lot with static sites, and roots is here to push those limits.\n\n***Why is WebriQ using Roots?***\n\nThe short answer is because roots was built very specifically for static site builds, so it's cleaner and better than general purpose build tools, since it's specialized to that purpose. The longer answer is that it's a qualitative thing. Much like people would ask \"Why should I use snapchat when I can just text a photo\" or \"Why should I use slack when I already have hipchat?\", there is no logical answer other than that the experience is different, and in my opinion, much better -- tailored exactly to what you need. So just try it, and you just might find that you really like it.\n\nAs awesome as Static Site Generators are, there are a few problems rooted in the fact that it gets a bit complex for the everyday admin user that’s just looking to publish content. It’s unrealistic for us in the agency world to get non-technical team members and clients to publish content and deploy websites via CLI.\nIn order to make this appealing to the masses, we need a dynamic layer in our current stack that provides a friendly admin UI…\n\n### Step 3: Select a headless CMS\n\n**Choosing between a Git-based CMS or an API-driven CMS**\n\nWith a Git-based CMS you can publish content every time you push changes to Git, allowing for a seamless development workflow. This approach is a bit difficult to scale with content that you want to publish across different platforms, but it will allow for you to have a purely static website. Since it runs on Git, you won’t have a problem finding an open source CMS to work with.\n\nWith an API-driven CMS, you’re creating content that will be strictly delivered via APIs. Although you won’t be able to keep track of content changes through Git, you’ll be able to scale your content through flexible APIs. But since you are working on a platform that hosts these APIs (server bandwidth ain’t cheap) these tend to not be open-sourced and rather pricey, but some offer freemium pricing models.\n\nOr use **[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com)**, which in essence can be an API driven Git-based CMS. \n\nExciting times for all front-end developers and for business owners who want to simplify their web operations with secure, reliable and ultra fast technologies.

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\nYou are most likely familiar with Wordpress to build a website. Wordpress is using what is called in technical terms the LAMP Stack. Static websites are using the JAM Stack. \nJAM Stack stands for JavaScript, APIs, & Markup; it’s an approach to building websites that allows you to have all the web performance and security benefits of a static website along with the dynamic capabilities of a database-driven CMS.\n\n## **Problems dynamic websites build with f.ex. Wordpress are facing**\nLet’s start with web performance. Regardless of how well we optimize everything or how good of a job we do with with perceived performance, dynamic websites are SLOW. This is due to the amount of steps that have to take place in order to display the requested content everytime someone visits a web page.\nWe’re also at a point where every website being built on Wordpress  is being overwhelmingly loaded with plugins, scripts, and a ton of other overhead that just slows the crap out of what we ship to production. This is in addition to security concerns, expensive hosting, and the ever-changing landscape of different languages a developer must learn to build a website.\nSo let’s rethink our approach to building dynamic websites and start from scratch static.\n\n## **How Static Websites Differ**\nFirst, what’s a static website? Nope, not a new technology, static websites have been around for ages. That Dreamweaver website you created back in college? That’s a static website. A website made up of HTML pages with pre-populated content.\nWhen a browser requests the URL of a static page, the server returns the static page in it’s entirety. There aren’t calls to a database being made nor content being generated on the fly — the content is already there.\nThat doesn’t mean we’re putting together every page by hand . There are different tools that address different layers of this technology stack. \n\n**Faster loading times**\n\nThe fact that JAMstack websites don’t have to make any calls to a database makes the loading time exponentially quicker.\nMatt Biilmann, founder of Netlify, ran a test of the Smashing Magazine website (which currently runs on WordPress) against a static counterpart he cloned and deployed on Netlify. It resulted in a website that loaded six times faster than the original.\n\n**Solid Security**\n\nIf you’re using a popular CMS, you know about the necessary security measures. This is mostly due to the login page being available to anyone with access to the website and some basic knowledge of the specific CMS. With a static website, a login page doesn’t exist.\nIf you do integrate a headless CMS (more on what a headless CMS is further down) to your static website, tracking the website back to its CMS isn’t as straightforward as it is with a traditional CMS.\n\n**Front-End and CMS are Decoupled**\n\nYou don’t have a CMS dictating the way you should structure your content and pages. Not having a CMS tied in to the presentation layer gives you the flexibility of creating anything you want on the front-end while using the API endpoints to pull in content.\n\n**Lower cost of scaling**\n\nWe’re not dealing with expensive runtimes or complicated server setups — we’re only dealing with static files being served on the client side. For smaller sites, you can get away with cheap hosting as long as you pair it with a fast CDN.\n\n**Seamless developer experience**\n\nFrom the developer’s perspective, the JAMstack methodology doesn’t require us to learn a different backend language to build a data-driven website.

        "content": "\nContinuing from [part 1](https://darjanpanic.com/design/concept-for-a-better-netlify-cms-editor-part-1/) this post is going to be more practical and explain some solutions that could be used to either improve or be starting stone for the next [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)that the community could build upon.\n\nHere are some goals from all the data and research gathered in part 1 that I’ll try to solve or improve:\n\n- should have the ability to add sections while writing\n- should have default and customisable content blocks/sections\n- should have pre-made templates/layouts for specific content collection pages (example, job posting)\n- should be easily usable by any of the 3 groups of people\n- should give an experience of uninterrupted writing, the writer should stay in “the zone” from the beginning to the end of the article\n\nAlso, [Shawn](https://twitter.com/erquhart) (Netlify CMS lead architect) gave some valuable feedback, especially that the average WordPress user still wants to use the mouse. So the goal of creating an “uninterrupted experience” for writers inside a CMS is limited by that as my main idea was to use just the keyboard without the mouse when inputting or writing text in the editor.\n\nBut after a short break, it’s not really a limitation as we can always use **both writing flows** so the user can use either one he prefers. Now the new method without the mouse would need a bit of training and would require a small learning curve but the user could choose which one he prefers after. Let’s look at it more of an evolution.\n\nLet’s dive into different sections step by step on how all the parts would fit together, visual examples with some explanations behind them.\n\nNote that there are 2 different editor uses in the CMS and it’s easier if you have only 1 editor for both. There are pages/blog posts which tend to be empty and you create or add layouts/sections based on the content or the desired structure (the layout is based on content). And the second use is for premade pages or content that already have defined inputs, like a job posting or a profile page (content is based on layout/structure).\n\n### Biggest problem of most CMS are the quantity of input fields\n\nHiding all the buttons we don’t really need help keep our canvas clean and the things we write structured. But again CMS’s can have these inputs and options all over the place.\n\nHere’s an example of a site I designed for my wife’s business and how the building blocks and options are used in WordPress and ACF.\n\nNow I really think this can be improved. There are many problems here like the one that you need to really search for either some settings or content if you want to edit it. The database is called for each of those fields on the front end and making lots of queries. Now static sites fix the later but the writing/editing experience is in blocks and not a fluid way of content. Everything is just too complex and all over the place. Hiding things in tabs makes it cleaner but the overview of the whole content on that page is really poor.\n\nWhat if the content for a CMS would just go two ways, right (writing) and down (scanning) without any tabs etc.? And you would also see everything just by scrolling the page, without clicking or opening things up.\n\nBlank canvas or writing without limits\n--------------------------------------\n\nThere is a minimum of input fields needed here but the basic and minimal ones are mostly:\n\n- Featured image\n- Title of the post\n- Editor field for the content\n\nNow to bring this together in the cleanest and minimal sense possible would look something like this.\n\nThe square button with the + inside is for a popup to upload the image and below we have the I-beam pointer (blinking |-cursor) that we’re used to. This is the main indicator to start writing or rather the cursor is waiting for the input.\n\nThe light grey coloured title is, in my opinion, a nice touch or a bonus that invites the user (motivates and gives assurance) to do great things. It’d be great to have more questions or inspiring copy here that is randomly changing. It’s something that’s been around for a long time (usually newsletters had input placeholders and Paper is also using it today). But imagine adding a “brands voice & tone” to this message for your writers and making it more personal?\n\nNext thing is the title input. Like Paper from Dropbox and some other editors have already found out, there isn’t any need to have visible input fields or text inputs. Things just flow nicely here.\n\nAfter writing the title and hitting enter/return key. You jump outside the title field and start the paragraph of that section. Really clean and simple. Again, no boxes, no toolbars or anything.\n\n### Toolbars and styling text\n\nMost of the current (or old if you want) editors have a lot of buttons or different ways to manipulate or style the information we provide. Which is great but we have too many options and the canvas gets messy. Things have evolved and we can evolve them even further.\n\nWriting things in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is great and the most important thing is, **you don’t need to switch to the mouse and use it**. Yes, the writers may need to learn some of these things, but they’re really intuitive and do improve the writing and the experience. UX/UI tends to overfocus on making things easier, but we don’t always need to improve the product so it’s easier to people to use it. Why not teach people to use the product as it’s meant to be used? It’s similar to the driving licence, you want to drive on the road, you need the training to handle the car. You want to have a better writing experience, learn Markdown. Some say it’s a “programming language” or meant for programmers, I say it’s not. It just brings some more “rules” to the writing we already have. Just look at this text, we’ve used – . , ; / ” ! ? and other characters since early school days. Markdown just introduces some new ones or extends their usability.\n\nWe tend to “dumb down” the product which also has the effect of not making some things challenging for the user (dumbing users down). They want to grow too, try new things and evolve as much as we evolve our products.\n\nBut let’s not make the mistake of not giving the user a choice here. We need to cover both user experiences here. The old and the new. The user tries both and he decides what to use. We still need to educate about the new approach though.\n\nThe [Alloy Editor](http://alloyeditor.com/demo/) which was also mentioned in [Netlify CMS Github issue](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/288#issuecomment-287556577) is a nice solution. It’s visible when you need it keeping the canvas clean. We just need to pair it with Markdown and use the selection menu as a **“fallback”** or an alternative option to styling things. And since both ways of styling are “hidden” they won’t get in each others way.\n\nHere’s Alloy Editor in action:\n\n**So we don’t need toolbars at all.** But we still keep the functionality and the clean look.\n\n### \n\n### Having an editor without really using one\n\nWith today’s popularity of React.js and even Vue.js it’s a lot easier to create an amazing experience for writing content. As mentioned earlier, we don’t really need to see input fields and text area boxes like we’re used to with WordPress and Advanced custom fields. We also don’t need to see these fields or borders, we just need to know the structure of the content or end result and React.js can take care of everything else behind the scenes, magically.\n\nA really nice and currently popular way of adding blocks of content is the + button next to the new paragraph. You click it and then you can choose what kind of “layout” or information placeholder you would like to add at that point. Netlify CMS already is using it and so are more and more other editors. I like this concept of “building blocks” and adding things like images is really a nice experience.\n\nMy concept/idea would improve that. You would write text like you do in Google Docs or Word, but the CMS would create hints on what and where the information will be explained. It would add the context of that information. And you would have minimalistic visual guides on what that content/layout is. The mentioned Alloy Editor already has a similar feature, but it can again be improved for the use in a CMS Editor.\n\nThis is how the basics would look. You click the + button and then you get displayed the layouts you could use. Remember, these blocks could be anything from ads to a call action block.\n\nIt’s something similar Netlify CMS already has. But again, we need to go in and click, input stuff and then we can continue with the writing. Also, it’s an improvement over the WordPress way I did above, but let’s try and make it right.\n\nPutting it all together and making it work\n------------------------------------------\n\nNow things seem to be going places but there are still different concepts here which don’t yet fit perfectly well together. I think one of the things that would tie all this together nicely are the mentioned visual guides for the content blocks. Remember, that we’re still making a CMS Editor here but we want it to feel like a Word document. OR even better like something we would write on paper.\n\nWe would need a system of grouping things together for the content blocks.\n\nLet’s try and analyse a simple landing page example with the above ideas. We start with how things would look without any grouping.\n\nLeft is a line sketch of the text and right are the sections or content blocks. This is the view we get in the Editor, not the front end, but as I said that I want the text to flow right and down it will keep the structure of the front end as much as possible. I wouldn’t use any columns in the editor.\n\nOne common way would be to make the background gray and make the sections white.\n\nBut this again created blocky content and the content doesn’t flow. We also introduced new (bigger) elements instead of using what was already there. So let’s take a step back and try color coding the things that are already there.\n\nThis variation above would color the text separating the blocks. But there would be a problem if you had 2 same blocks one after another as they would look as one. So let’s try and minimise this even further but still use the colors.\n\nWe keep the colors and just use a small line at the left side of the content block visually grouping the content on the right making everything clean and structured. But just the color may not be enough for first-time users so the icons for the content blocks should also be used, but these can be hidden until you hover over it.\n\n### \n\n### Content blocks of the new CMS\n\nIf we have a blank page without any inputs, it’s hard to know what the new blocks need to input. For some it may be easier as you would just write a sentence, but what about a CTA? It can have a title, paragraph, button text, button url, url target etc.\n\nThat’s why new blocks would need to have labels so we can “fill them in”. It’s the main thing that makes any CMS work really. Here’s the CTA block when it’s empty.\n\nAnd here’s the same block when full.\n\nAn image block also needs and “upload” or gallery button or that functionality. Here’s an example of how the different states would work.\n\nNow on the front end, there should be things in place so that if we want to add more images to the above block, it would automatically add columns (or creates a gallery) for it. Add 3 images makes it a 3 column gallery. So depending on the input, display the correct output (side thought: anyone thinking of adding AI to this).\n\nHere’s an example of how 2 columned texts would look like in a block.\n\nSo depending on the content/context, a CMS editor must not limit us in any way. Custom content blocks or widgets in Netlify CMS are amazing for this.\n\nUsing the editor without the mouse, ever.\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe only enjoyable thing when using the mouse while writing should be clicking on the Publish button 🙂 And with that in mind I’ve been thinking how to improve the user experience throught everything mentioned above. How would we achieve navigating the UI and add content blocks by just using the keyboard but also not using any CTRL or ALT combos? Well, we go for the obvious key that we’re using all the time but can be used for much more than just the thing it’s doing. Yes, it’s the Enter/Return key.\n\nYou’re probably asking yourself how can you navigate the full UI with just one key that is already used to paragraphs or line breaks (enter and shift+enter).

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\nContinuing from [part 1](https://darjanpanic.com/design/concept-for-a-better-netlify-cms-editor-part-1/) this post is going to be more practical and explain some solutions that could be used to either improve or be starting stone for the next [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)that the community could build upon.\n\nHere are some goals from all the data and research gathered in part 1 that I’ll try to solve or improve:\n\n- should have the ability to add sections while writing\n- should have default and customisable content blocks/sections\n- should have pre-made templates/layouts for specific content collection pages (example, job posting)\n- should be easily usable by any of the 3 groups of people\n- should give an experience of uninterrupted writing, the writer should stay in “the zone” from the beginning to the end of the article\n\nAlso, [Shawn](https://twitter.com/erquhart) (Netlify CMS lead architect) gave some valuable feedback, especially that the average WordPress user still wants to use the mouse. So the goal of creating an “uninterrupted experience” for writers inside a CMS is limited by that as my main idea was to use just the keyboard without the mouse when inputting or writing text in the editor.\n\nBut after a short break, it’s not really a limitation as we can always use **both writing flows** so the user can use either one he prefers. Now the new method without the mouse would need a bit of training and would require a small learning curve but the user could choose which one he prefers after. Let’s look at it more of an evolution.\n\nLet’s dive into different sections step by step on how all the parts would fit together, visual examples with some explanations behind them.\n\nNote that there are 2 different editor uses in the CMS and it’s easier if you have only 1 editor for both. There are pages/blog posts which tend to be empty and you create or add layouts/sections based on the content or the desired structure (the layout is based on content). And the second use is for premade pages or content that already have defined inputs, like a job posting or a profile page (content is based on layout/structure).\n\n### Biggest problem of most CMS are the quantity of input fields\n\nHiding all the buttons we don’t really need help keep our canvas clean and the things we write structured. But again CMS’s can have these inputs and options all over the place.\n\nHere’s an example of a site I designed for my wife’s business and how the building blocks and options are used in WordPress and ACF.\n\nNow I really think this can be improved. There are many problems here like the one that you need to really search for either some settings or content if you want to edit it. The database is called for each of those fields on the front end and making lots of queries. Now static sites fix the later but the writing/editing experience is in blocks and not a fluid way of content. Everything is just too complex and all over the place. Hiding things in tabs makes it cleaner but the overview of the whole content on that page is really poor.\n\nWhat if the content for a CMS would just go two ways, right (writing) and down (scanning) without any tabs etc.? And you would also see everything just by scrolling the page, without clicking or opening things up.\n\nBlank canvas or writing without limits\n--------------------------------------\n\nThere is a minimum of input fields needed here but the basic and minimal ones are mostly:\n\n- Featured image\n- Title of the post\n- Editor field for the content\n\nNow to bring this together in the cleanest and minimal sense possible would look something like this.\n\nThe square button with the + inside is for a popup to upload the image and below we have the I-beam pointer (blinking |-cursor) that we’re used to. This is the main indicator to start writing or rather the cursor is waiting for the input.\n\nThe light grey coloured title is, in my opinion, a nice touch or a bonus that invites the user (motivates and gives assurance) to do great things. It’d be great to have more questions or inspiring copy here that is randomly changing. It’s something that’s been around for a long time (usually newsletters had input placeholders and Paper is also using it today). But imagine adding a “brands voice & tone” to this message for your writers and making it more personal?\n\nNext thing is the title input. Like Paper from Dropbox and some other editors have already found out, there isn’t any need to have visible input fields or text inputs. Things just flow nicely here.\n\nAfter writing the title and hitting enter/return key. You jump outside the title field and start the paragraph of that section. Really clean and simple. Again, no boxes, no toolbars or anything.\n\n### Toolbars and styling text\n\nMost of the current (or old if you want) editors have a lot of buttons or different ways to manipulate or style the information we provide. Which is great but we have too many options and the canvas gets messy. Things have evolved and we can evolve them even further.\n\nWriting things in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is great and the most important thing is, **you don’t need to switch to the mouse and use it**. Yes, the writers may need to learn some of these things, but they’re really intuitive and do improve the writing and the experience. UX/UI tends to overfocus on making things easier, but we don’t always need to improve the product so it’s easier to people to use it. Why not teach people to use the product as it’s meant to be used? It’s similar to the driving licence, you want to drive on the road, you need the training to handle the car. You want to have a better writing experience, learn Markdown. Some say it’s a “programming language” or meant for programmers, I say it’s not. It just brings some more “rules” to the writing we already have. Just look at this text, we’ve used – . , ; / ” ! ? and other characters since early school days. Markdown just introduces some new ones or extends their usability.\n\nWe tend to “dumb down” the product which also has the effect of not making some things challenging for the user (dumbing users down). They want to grow too, try new things and evolve as much as we evolve our products.\n\nBut let’s not make the mistake of not giving the user a choice here. We need to cover both user experiences here. The old and the new. The user tries both and he decides what to use. We still need to educate about the new approach though.\n\nThe [Alloy Editor](http://alloyeditor.com/demo/) which was also mentioned in [Netlify CMS Github issue](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/288#issuecomment-287556577) is a nice solution. It’s visible when you need it keeping the canvas clean. We just need to pair it with Markdown and use the selection menu as a **“fallback”** or an alternative option to styling things. And since both ways of styling are “hidden” they won’t get in each others way.\n\nHere’s Alloy Editor in action:\n\n**So we don’t need toolbars at all.** But we still keep the functionality and the clean look.\n\n### \n\n### Having an editor without really using one\n\nWith today’s popularity of React.js and even Vue.js it’s a lot easier to create an amazing experience for writing content. As mentioned earlier, we don’t really need to see input fields and text area boxes like we’re used to with WordPress and Advanced custom fields. We also don’t need to see these fields or borders, we just need to know the structure of the content or end result and React.js can take care of everything else behind the scenes, magically.\n\nA really nice and currently popular way of adding blocks of content is the + button next to the new paragraph. You click it and then you can choose what kind of “layout” or information placeholder you would like to add at that point. Netlify CMS already is using it and so are more and more other editors. I like this concept of “building blocks” and adding things like images is really a nice experience.\n\nMy concept/idea would improve that. You would write text like you do in Google Docs or Word, but the CMS would create hints on what and where the information will be explained. It would add the context of that information. And you would have minimalistic visual guides on what that content/layout is. The mentioned Alloy Editor already has a similar feature, but it can again be improved for the use in a CMS Editor.\n\nThis is how the basics would look. You click the + button and then you get displayed the layouts you could use. Remember, these blocks could be anything from ads to a call action block.\n\nIt’s something similar Netlify CMS already has. But again, we need to go in and click, input stuff and then we can continue with the writing. Also, it’s an improvement over the WordPress way I did above, but let’s try and make it right.\n\nPutting it all together and making it work\n------------------------------------------\n\nNow things seem to be going places but there are still different concepts here which don’t yet fit perfectly well together. I think one of the things that would tie all this together nicely are the mentioned visual guides for the content blocks. Remember, that we’re still making a CMS Editor here but we want it to feel like a Word document. OR even better like something we would write on paper.\n\nWe would need a system of grouping things together for the content blocks.\n\nLet’s try and analyse a simple landing page example with the above ideas. We start with how things would look without any grouping.\n\nLeft is a line sketch of the text and right are the sections or content blocks. This is the view we get in the Editor, not the front end, but as I said that I want the text to flow right and down it will keep the structure of the front end as much as possible. I wouldn’t use any columns in the editor.\n\nOne common way would be to make the background gray and make the sections white.\n\nBut this again created blocky content and the content doesn’t flow. We also introduced new (bigger) elements instead of using what was already there. So let’s take a step back and try color coding the things that are already there.\n\nThis variation above would color the text separating the blocks. But there would be a problem if you had 2 same blocks one after another as they would look as one. So let’s try and minimise this even further but still use the colors.\n\nWe keep the colors and just use a small line at the left side of the content block visually grouping the content on the right making everything clean and structured. But just the color may not be enough for first-time users so the icons for the content blocks should also be used, but these can be hidden until you hover over it.\n\n### \n\n### Content blocks of the new CMS\n\nIf we have a blank page without any inputs, it’s hard to know what the new blocks need to input. For some it may be easier as you would just write a sentence, but what about a CTA? It can have a title, paragraph, button text, button url, url target etc.\n\nThat’s why new blocks would need to have labels so we can “fill them in”. It’s the main thing that makes any CMS work really. Here’s the CTA block when it’s empty.\n\nAnd here’s the same block when full.\n\nAn image block also needs and “upload” or gallery button or that functionality. Here’s an example of how the different states would work.\n\nNow on the front end, there should be things in place so that if we want to add more images to the above block, it would automatically add columns (or creates a gallery) for it. Add 3 images makes it a 3 column gallery. So depending on the input, display the correct output (side thought: anyone thinking of adding AI to this).\n\nHere’s an example of how 2 columned texts would look like in a block.\n\nSo depending on the content/context, a CMS editor must not limit us in any way. Custom content blocks or widgets in Netlify CMS are amazing for this.\n\nUsing the editor without the mouse, ever.\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe only enjoyable thing when using the mouse while writing should be clicking on the Publish button 🙂 And with that in mind I’ve been thinking how to improve the user experience throught everything mentioned above. How would we achieve navigating the UI and add content blocks by just using the keyboard but also not using any CTRL or ALT combos? Well, we go for the obvious key that we’re using all the time but can be used for much more than just the thing it’s doing. Yes, it’s the Enter/Return key.\n\nYou’re probably asking yourself how can you navigate the full UI with just one key that is already used to paragraphs or line breaks (enter and shift+enter). Well, I think with the help of React and JS we could extend the usability. Here’s a short video explanation of how it would work. The right side shows the key inputs used to navigate.\n\nFrom the video above the legend of the navigation would be:\n\n- **1x enter** -> new paragraph\n- **2x enter in succession** -> open block list (same as clicking the +)\n- **space** -> select the block layout\n\nThis should work nicely for the 1st pass of writing, for the second pass of editing, it’d still be nice to use the mouse as it makes the jump from words to words easier.\n\nI think this is something that was overlooked with all the Editors we have today. We always try adding new things instead of doing the basics really good (oh wait, isn’t that the JAMstack philosophy also?).\n\nCanvas with placeholders for inputting information and data\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the example of using the Editor for layouts that are predefined with blocks depending on the context (job posting, real estate posting,…) A bit of setup in the JSON config file would do the trick to create the template layout.\n\nAdd a collection and you have a controlled placeholder for specific content needed for that section.\n\nConclusion & next steps\n-----------------------\n\nIt’s been a while since I tried to solve a problem or find a new solution to something like this and I must say that an editor seems like an “easy thing to do” but digging deeper it has a lot of small gears that make everything work, the process if analysed in depth is quite complex but I love how things come out simple at the end and seem intuitive.\n\nThere is still more things to think about like the mobile execution of this concept or the idea that do we still need the preview if the content is shown in a straight path?\n\nI guess the next steps (maybe a part 3?) would be to wait for feedback and revise and improve with the help of the community while enjoying the development of Netlify CMS.\n\n ",

Interfaces got better, architecture became more efficient and the way marketers have controlled and measured content has continuously been improving.\n\nFrom breaking classic bottlenecks to the current rise of personalization, the waves of change in enterprise needs is directly reflected in the way they choose to manage their digital empire.\n\n **Wave 1: Breaking the IT Bottleneck\n----------------------------------** It was the late '90s, and everyone wanted to get their business online.\n\nAt the time, doing so required each edit to go through a webmaster with their html authoring tools. Needless to say this bottleneck frustrated marketers and they looked for a way to create pages themselves.\n\nEnter XML forms, where editors could fill in information, add in business logic, store the information in a shared database and publish on any application. It was the beginning of the separation of content and presentation and, for the businesses exploring digital, it was revolutionary. Without the need of a webmaster, an end user could fire up the form, generate the page, preview and publish, all with a separation of content that allowed raw data to be used in multiple spots.\n\n **Wave 2: Speed in the Age of the Digital Marketer\n------------------------------------------------** We had separation of concerns, we had reusability, we had workflow — and then all of that faded away with the next evolution of market demands.\n\nMarketers wanted to control not only the content but the presentation, something the custom XML templates didn’t offer. And they wanted to do this at speed, quickly being able to build and optimize landing pages, mobile sites, microsites and the like.\n\nAt the time channels were very siloed, with one person responsible for the desktop site, another for mobile, another for customer portals and so on. Each digital marketer had complete control over their channel, creating separate architecture for each and not considering content reuse across the channels they didn’t own.\n\nInline editing skyrocketed at this time. It allowed digital marketers to visually tweak their channel as much as they wanted, but this meant the content was locked to a single page. The industry put content re-use and workflow on the back burner to cater to separate business channels.\n\nAnd for a time, this worked. Channel editors controlled their domain with the speed they wanted. But it was only a matter of time before the obvious flaw in these disjointed channels became apparent, in the next wave of the online experience.\n\n **Wave 3: Cross-Channel Customers\n-------------------------------** Businesses soon realized that even if they managed their channels separately, customers saw them as one and the same. Customers expected the information, and overall tone of experience, to remain consistent whether they were on mobile, an app, desktop or any other touchpoint.\n\nBusinesses tasked with focusing on the entire customer experience were faced with the reality that content lifecycles from one channel to the next were simply broken.\n\nThe solution was a return of structured content, and technology vendors rushed to do so. Marketers could fill out content in forms and preview that content in the context of multiple channels. As businesses invested more in content, especially the emotional influence it had on their customers, they needed to unlock the ROI by reusing it across absolutely every touchpoint.\n\nThe need for reusable content saw the return of neutral forms — but marketers were used to the control over presentation they had with inline editing. Web content management vendors reacted in multiple ways. Some remained page-based with inline editing, some went the headless route and let a third-party worry about content display and others linked a preview mode to the content editing mode to quickly toggle back and forth.\n\n **Wave 4: The Rise of Personalization\n-----------------------------------** The separation of content and presentation doesn’t just aid in cross-channel, it’s also a critical component in delivering the personalized experience today’s customers expect. Personalization requires not only this separation of concerns, but also the ability to attach metadata to re-usable content.\n\nInline editing, where changes to content are made in the context of a specific page, simply isn’t built to offer cross-channel, personalized and consistent customer journeys. A quick YouTube search for vendors’ editing capabilities will show slick demos with inline editing but when a company wants to roll out personalization across all channels, they ultimately end up using metadata friendly forms.\n\nSo is personalization and cross-channel consistency the death of inline editing? Of course not. Because when new industry needs arrive, new solutions quickly follow. Marketers need a way to organize metadata, easily target content, keep a consistent brand experience and remain in control of channel presentation. Enter visual editing.\n\nWith visual editing, marketers can instantly see their changes in context — across different channel perspectives, personas and targeting efforts — and, importantly, the changes are made to the underlying content repository. This means that any edits made in context, such as fixing errors, updating links or adding an image, will be carried over to every location that content is used: from remote display units to mobile apps.\n\nThis type of visual editing won't remain a rarity for long, it’s simply where market needs are directing the experience management industry because large scale, [AI-driven hyper-personalization](http://blogs.forrester.com/joe_stanhope/17-06-05-just_what_do_you_think_youre_doing_dave_marketers_must_get_ready_for_ai_powered_marketing) is what enterprises will look to for competitive advantage.\n\nBusinesses relying on solutions without a separation of content and presentation will lack the metadata capabilities and thus miss the omnichannel, personalization boat.\n\n Tjeerd Brenninkmeijer is the CMO of BloomReach EMEA. He is a frequent contributor to industry publications and a speaker at industry events.\n \n Using the traditional monolitic approach whereby you build, manage and publish your website on a single server, there is a more distributed approach whereby you build your site on a Static Site Generator, publish the site on GIT repositories and host the site on a Content Delivery Network.\n\n# **Choosing between a Git-based CMS or an API-driven CMS**\n\nWith a Git-based CMS you can publish content every time you push changes to Git, allowing for a seamless development workflow. This approach is a bit difficult to scale with content that you want to publish across different platforms, but it will allow for you to have a purely static website. Since it runs on Git, you won’t have a problem finding an open source CMS to work with.\n\nWith an API-driven CMS, you’re creating content that will be strictly delivered via APIs. Although you won’t be able to keep track of content changes through Git, you’ll be able to scale your content through flexible APIs. But since you are working on a platform that hosts these APIs (server bandwidth ain’t cheap) these tend to not be open-sourced and rather pricey, but some offer freemium pricing models.\n\nOr use **[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com)**, which in essence can be an API driven Git-based CMS.\n\n\n\n",

This means that any edits made in context, such as fixing errors, updating links or adding an image, will be carried over to every location that content is used: from remote display units to mobile apps.\n\nThis type of visual editing won't remain a rarity for long, it’s simply where market needs are directing the experience management industry because large scale, [AI-driven hyper-personalization](http://blogs.forrester.com/joe_stanhope/17-06-05-just_what_do_you_think_youre_doing_dave_marketers_must_get_ready_for_ai_powered_marketing) is what enterprises will look to for competitive advantage.\n\nBusinesses relying on solutions without a separation of content and presentation will lack the metadata capabilities and thus miss the omnichannel, personalization boat.\n\n Tjeerd Brenninkmeijer is the CMO of BloomReach EMEA. He is a frequent contributor to industry publications and a speaker at industry events.\n \n Using the traditional monolitic approach whereby you build, manage and publish your website on a single server, there is a more distributed approach whereby you build your site on a Static Site Generator, publish the site on GIT repositories and host the site on a Content Delivery Network.\n\n# **Choosing between a Git-based CMS or an API-driven CMS**\n\nWith a Git-based CMS you can publish content every time you push changes to Git, allowing for a seamless development workflow. This approach is a bit difficult to scale with content that you want to publish across different platforms, but it will allow for you to have a purely static website. Since it runs on Git, you won’t have a problem finding an open source CMS to work with.\n\nWith an API-driven CMS, you’re creating content that will be strictly delivered via APIs. Although you won’t be able to keep track of content changes through Git, you’ll be able to scale your content through flexible APIs. But since you are working on a platform that hosts these APIs (server bandwidth ain’t cheap) these tend to not be open-sourced and rather pricey, but some offer freemium pricing models.\n\nOr use **[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com)**, which in essence can be an API driven Git-based CMS.\n\n\n\n",

Open-source platforms have focused much more on extensibility, making them truer “platforms” in that they can be easily built upon. Commercial “products” haven’t focused on extensibility as much as they have on feature sets that help them demo and sell licenses more easily. But one thing is common across all of these options: They’ve become more and more bloated as they try harder and harder to accommodate more use cases.\n\nTraditional CMS systems are called monolithic because they pack all functionality, presentation and assumptions of how you work in one single system. They are called legacy because they have been around for quite a while, are build on old(er) technology stacks. In the last 5 years, the traditional CMS landscape has not evolved much - both CMS technologies as well market maturity remains unchanged. There is hardly any innovation from traditional CMS vendors. Although some vendors have added support for APIs and cloud services most have not even bothered to adapt with changing technology landscape. Case-in-point, most enterprise CMS vendors lack robust full-site content delivery network (CDN) integration. In fact, CDN support is often limited to static assets not realizing that with the arrival of HTTP2 domain sharding is a thing of past. \nWhen it comes to innovation, most of CMS solutions are constrained by their legacy architecture (read strong coupling between content management and content presentation) which makes it difficult to serve content to new types of emerging channels such as apps and devices. API support is critical for innovation but it needs to be a first-class citizen and not afterthought. In addition, traditional CMS solutions lack integration with modern software stack, cloud services, and software delivery pipelines. Possibility to apply continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) concepts with a traditional CMS is mostly unheard-of. At the core, a traditional CMS is a monoliath. Any organization pursuing micro services strategy will find hard to fit a traditional CMS in their ecosystem.\n\n## What is a Headless CMS?\nA headless CMS has no presentation layer and makes content available through  APIs. With a headless CMS, the task of the content presentation is performed by an external client consuming APIs exposed by headless CMS. Here are few examples of an external client utilising the APIs exposed by a headless CMS: static site generator (SSG), single page application (SPA) (client-side as well as server-side rendering), a mobile app, a WordPress site, or an IoT device. These are usually called “Headless” or “API-first” CMSs. Some of them market themselves as “Content infrastructure,” “Content Hubs” or even “Content as a Service.” However, when you take a closer look, they all pretty much boil down to some database backend with a web-based user interface, where you access the content through an API. But WTF is an API?\n\n## What is an API?\nAPI stands for Application Programming Interface, which in this context means that you get content in a way that is easier to integrate with existing or new software solutions. Usually, you do this by sending a network request to an endpoint. This network request is pretty much the same thing you do when visiting a webpage, e.g., https://yourdomain.com/api/posts/, but instead of a web page, you get a list with the post’s contents back.\nDevelopers can use this information when building software, be it an app, a voice interface, or a webpage. Most of today's developers are used to programming with APIs and prefer them because it leaves them in control for how to build their systems. Some CMSs also allow changing content through APIs. API is a pretty generic term and goes beyond the world of CMSs and the World Wide Web.\nMost Headless CMS systems will expose their content through a REST API. REST APIs can be great for simple data structures but tend to get tedious and time-consuming to use when your content models are more complex. It's also a more laborious exercise to change or fit these APIs for different uses.\nFacebook developed the API standard GraphQL as a response to the less flexible REST convention. GraphQL lets you query the API with the fields and relationships you need for each occasion, almost like what you can do directly with a database. It's also easier to implement new fields and content types as your system matures.\n\n## Headless CMS will render its content through APIs and Application Delivery Networks\nA CDN has become a lot easier and cheaper. Now a day there are so many options - Amazon CloudFront, Cloudflare, Google CDN, Azure CDN, Edgecast, Fastly, and the list goes on. Gone the days when you required to have big fat-contract with Akamai. With most of CDN services, you can start small and pay as you go. Having a CDN in front of origin (static site or APIs) reduces the global and regional latency. This is achieved by caching content (static HTML page, assets, APIs) at a large number of geographically distributed edge locations. In addition, CDNs scale really well - we are talking about 5-10k concurrent requests without any issues. To protect origin server from request overload some CDNs also support origin shield - an additional caching layer between edge and origin servers. Typically, this mid-tier caching is a designate edge or pop location closer to your origin server and other edge servers query origin shield rather than origin directly.\nHosting companies like Netlify refer to their CDN infrastructure as Application Delivery Network (ADN), which has no distinction between edge and origin servers. This is primarily to support the atomic deploy model and instant cache invalidation so that there is no risk of stale content or inconsistent state. With ADN, switching between multiple version of a static site is as easy as changing symlink to a directory. Atomic deploy model can be extended to advanced functionalities such as staging, instant rollbacks, phased rollouts, and A/B testing. Many conventional CDNs are unable to support some of these features due to restrictions and limitations around the instant cache purge. For example, some CDNs rate limit the cache invalidation, while others charge for each cache invalidation request.\n\n## What can you expect from WebriQ GLUE\nWe have been designing and developing websites and web apps for a long time, and we have seen all the deficiencies of project based pricing, per hour pricing, unknowns in devops, unknowns in maintenance, overruns, delays etc.\nWe have developed a very opinionated way of implementing websites, ecommerce carts and webapps and we completely moved away from a monolithic, legacy and centralized approach.

Progressive Web Apps are for the hardcore web application developers creating the next online cloud-based Photoshop ? \n\nThen, I saw CSS wizard, Harry Roberts, tweet about making some setting changes in CloudFlare and achieving the same. It might have been a coincidence that I stumbled across two influencers discussing the same topic, but it still caught my eye. So out of curiosity, I installed Lighthouse, the Chrome plugin that both Smashing Magazine and Harry Roberts had used, and ran my website through it.\n\nInitial Lighthouse Audit\nI wasn’t too impressed with the results. I figured I’d look into this, write about it, and save any developers who stumble across my website a bit of time. But I was really surprised with what I found.\n\nI sought out to see if PWAs could benefit the work I do daily with content marketing websites, and I was able to reach 100/100. You’ll see exactly what I did toward the end of this article, but I figured while I’m here, we could walk through it together.\n\nTo begin, let’s get on the same page and define exactly what a PWA is. Google says:\n\nProgressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:\n\n**Reliable** - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.\n\n**Fast** - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.\n\n**Engaging** - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience. This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user’s home screen.\n\nIn other words, a PWA is the in between of a native app and a website. Using new technology being shipped with the latest browsers, we’re now able to create web apps, or in this case websites, that feature similar functionality as native iOS & Android apps (push notifications being a popular one).\n\nThe beauty of it is that we don’t need to be on a specific platform to be able to install a specific app — we just need a URL to point our mobile or desktop browsers to — but it is also one of the most challenging aspects of PWAs because ANY browser on ANY device could access the web app.\n\nThis means that we’ll be catering to users that probably won’t have the latest version of their browser with the latest features that you’re using. And that’s OK.\n\nPWAs are built with the core principle of the progressive enhancement. This means the app/website will focus on the core content or purpose, and it will use the latest and greatest features as an enhancement to the experience and not as a requirement. It won’t break or render useless if a specific feature isn’t available in the browser/device accessing it.\n\nWhy Your Website Should Be a Progressive Web App\nAlthough you probably won’t be using any hardcore app-like features for your website, there are a handful of enhancements, such as offline accessibility and native browser notifications, that will immediately improve the overall usability and engagement of your audience. It’ll result in higher conversions and lower bounce rates.\n\nThere’s even more to it:\n\n**Offline Accessibility with Service Workers**\n\nUsing service workers, we’re able to “download” your website for offline use. Even with our tech-savvy way of life, there are plenty of use cases for this — subway riders with no internet access reading your blog, plant managers with spotty wifi looking up specs, those driving into more rural areas, etc.\n\n**Native Browser Notifications**\n\nIf the website validates as a PWA, certain browsers take the initiative of displaying notifications such as offering to add the website to the home screen of the user — the PWA equivalent of installing an app.\n\n**Enabling Push Notifications**\n\nPush notifications are every developer and marketer’s favorite native app feature. When leveraging the Push API, you have the ability to re-engage your audience even when your website’s not being accessed.\n\n**Performance**\n\nWith service workers, we have granular control over caching static assets, which reduces network requests and results in improved performance.\n\n**Google Likes it**\n\nIf Google supports something, pay close attention. It won’t be long until Google starts favoring PWAs in certain search results. (You heard it here first!) Right now, there isn’t any evidence showing an increase in traffic; however, early adopters are usually the ones to reap the benefits.\n\n**Criteria for Progressive Web Apps**\nYour website has to meet a baseline of standards in order to benefit from the PWA perks, but these are best practices you should already be considering and implementing on your website. If not, listen up.\n\n**Site is served over HTTPS**\n\nThis is the secure version of your website. Sending information over HTTPS ensure any data that’s being passed through your website gets encrypted. Yes, even if your website is a simple content-based website with no complicated features, you want and need HTTPS (lots of bad hombres out there).\n\nYou can test for this with Lighthouse or just look at the address bar of your website and if the URL starts with https:// and not http://, you’re good to go. I use CloudFlare CDN, which makes it relatively simple to enable HTTPS.\n\n**Pages are responsive on tablets & mobile devices**\n\nBy now, everyone should be building on a responsive foundation. Do I even need to elaborate here? Thinking no, but let me know otherwise.\n\n**The start URL (at least) loads while offline**\n\nYour home page URL needs to be able to load if you don’t have access to the internet — use service workers (not as difficult as it sounds) to help. (I’ll show you how to do this shortly.)\n\n**Metadata provided for add to home screen**\n\nMobile browsers need basic information about your website such as an icon to represent your website on the home screen of a device, a short name (what gets displayed below your icon) and a browser theme color to match certain parts of the browser to the colors of your website (among many other options).\n\nThis gets accomplished through the web app manifest file, which is a simple JSON file that contains all of the specifics. (Again, I run you through setting one of these up toward the end of this post.)\n\n**First load is fast even on 3G**\n\nYour website needs to render fast. It should load within the first 4 seconds and get a 85+ PageSpeed Insights score as a minimum. I recently wrote an article on website speed performance, which goes over a few basic steps you can take to make sure your website loads pretty darn quick.\n\n**Site works cross-browser**\n\nEvery single feature doesn’t have to work on every browser but being able to progressively enhance and using fallbacks where necessary should be the foundation of your website or app. Don’t target a specific browser or OS for your website/app to work on — it’s a big negative that goes against the progressive principle.\n\n**Page transitions don’t feel like they block on the network**\n\nGoing from page to page should be a seamless experience — any type of render blocking delay deters you from achieving that. There are many ways to address this from making sure your website’s fast (two steps above) and using perceived performance techniques such as Critical CSS.\n\n**Each page has a URL**\n\nIf you click on a page, make sure the website URL reflects that. Single Page Applications sometimes forget this and make it pretty difficult to share content across the web.\n\nSeems like a handful of steps, but if your website is already built on a foundation of best practices, it won’t be much work to have it validate.\n\nMost of our [Buzzin](http://glasgow.buzzin.today) Community websites adhere to all the best practices of Progessive Web APPS.",

So out of curiosity, I installed Lighthouse, the Chrome plugin that both Smashing Magazine and Harry Roberts had used, and ran my website through it.\n\nInitial Lighthouse Audit\nI wasn’t too impressed with the results. I figured I’d look into this, write about it, and save any developers who stumble across my website a bit of time. But I was really surprised with what I found.\n\nI sought out to see if PWAs could benefit the work I do daily with content marketing websites, and I was able to reach 100/100. You’ll see exactly what I did toward the end of this article, but I figured while I’m here, we could walk through it together.\n\nTo begin, let’s get on the same page and define exactly what a PWA is. Google says:\n\nProgressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:\n\n**Reliable** - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.\n\n**Fast** - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.\n\n**Engaging** - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience. This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user’s home screen.\n\nIn other words, a PWA is the in between of a native app and a website. Using new technology being shipped with the latest browsers, we’re now able to create web apps, or in this case websites, that feature similar functionality as native iOS & Android apps (push notifications being a popular one).\n\nThe beauty of it is that we don’t need to be on a specific platform to be able to install a specific app — we just need a URL to point our mobile or desktop browsers to — but it is also one of the most challenging aspects of PWAs because ANY browser on ANY device could access the web app.\n\nThis means that we’ll be catering to users that probably won’t have the latest version of their browser with the latest features that you’re using. And that’s OK.\n\nPWAs are built with the core principle of the progressive enhancement. This means the app/website will focus on the core content or purpose, and it will use the latest and greatest features as an enhancement to the experience and not as a requirement. It won’t break or render useless if a specific feature isn’t available in the browser/device accessing it.\n\nWhy Your Website Should Be a Progressive Web App\nAlthough you probably won’t be using any hardcore app-like features for your website, there are a handful of enhancements, such as offline accessibility and native browser notifications, that will immediately improve the overall usability and engagement of your audience. It’ll result in higher conversions and lower bounce rates.\n\nThere’s even more to it:\n\n**Offline Accessibility with Service Workers**\n\nUsing service workers, we’re able to “download” your website for offline use. Even with our tech-savvy way of life, there are plenty of use cases for this — subway riders with no internet access reading your blog, plant managers with spotty wifi looking up specs, those driving into more rural areas, etc.\n\n**Native Browser Notifications**\n\nIf the website validates as a PWA, certain browsers take the initiative of displaying notifications such as offering to add the website to the home screen of the user — the PWA equivalent of installing an app.\n\n**Enabling Push Notifications**\n\nPush notifications are every developer and marketer’s favorite native app feature. When leveraging the Push API, you have the ability to re-engage your audience even when your website’s not being accessed.\n\n**Performance**\n\nWith service workers, we have granular control over caching static assets, which reduces network requests and results in improved performance.\n\n**Google Likes it**\n\nIf Google supports something, pay close attention. It won’t be long until Google starts favoring PWAs in certain search results. (You heard it here first!) Right now, there isn’t any evidence showing an increase in traffic; however, early adopters are usually the ones to reap the benefits.\n\n**Criteria for Progressive Web Apps**\nYour website has to meet a baseline of standards in order to benefit from the PWA perks, but these are best practices you should already be considering and implementing on your website. If not, listen up.\n\n**Site is served over HTTPS**\n\nThis is the secure version of your website. Sending information over HTTPS ensure any data that’s being passed through your website gets encrypted. Yes, even if your website is a simple content-based website with no complicated features, you want and need HTTPS (lots of bad hombres out there).\n\nYou can test for this with Lighthouse or just look at the address bar of your website and if the URL starts with https:// and not http://, you’re good to go. I use CloudFlare CDN, which makes it relatively simple to enable HTTPS.\n\n**Pages are responsive on tablets & mobile devices**\n\nBy now, everyone should be building on a responsive foundation. Do I even need to elaborate here? Thinking no, but let me know otherwise.\n\n**The start URL (at least) loads while offline**\n\nYour home page URL needs to be able to load if you don’t have access to the internet — use service workers (not as difficult as it sounds) to help. (I’ll show you how to do this shortly.)\n\n**Metadata provided for add to home screen**\n\nMobile browsers need basic information about your website such as an icon to represent your website on the home screen of a device, a short name (what gets displayed below your icon) and a browser theme color to match certain parts of the browser to the colors of your website (among many other options).\n\nThis gets accomplished through the web app manifest file, which is a simple JSON file that contains all of the specifics. (Again, I run you through setting one of these up toward the end of this post.)\n\n**First load is fast even on 3G**\n\nYour website needs to render fast. It should load within the first 4 seconds and get a 85+ PageSpeed Insights score as a minimum. I recently wrote an article on website speed performance, which goes over a few basic steps you can take to make sure your website loads pretty darn quick.\n\n**Site works cross-browser**\n\nEvery single feature doesn’t have to work on every browser but being able to progressively enhance and using fallbacks where necessary should be the foundation of your website or app. Don’t target a specific browser or OS for your website/app to work on — it’s a big negative that goes against the progressive principle.\n\n**Page transitions don’t feel like they block on the network**\n\nGoing from page to page should be a seamless experience — any type of render blocking delay deters you from achieving that. There are many ways to address this from making sure your website’s fast (two steps above) and using perceived performance techniques such as Critical CSS.\n\n**Each page has a URL**\n\nIf you click on a page, make sure the website URL reflects that. Single Page Applications sometimes forget this and make it pretty difficult to share content across the web.\n\nSeems like a handful of steps, but if your website is already built on a foundation of best practices, it won’t be much work to have it validate.\n\nMost of our [Buzzin](http://glasgow.buzzin.today) Community websites adhere to all the best practices of Progessive Web APPS.",

And now, with the headless CMS hype in full flow, the interest in these front-end solutions is returning.\n\nAfter listing the [best flat-file CMS](http://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/15-flat-file-cms-options-for-lean-website-building/) and the [best static site generators](http://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/15-static-site-generators-to-complement-your-headless-cms/) on offer — it’s time to formally identify what separates these two similar technologies.\n\nWhat Is a Static Site Generator?\n--------------------------------\n\nA static site generator does exactly what it says on the tin: it renders static websites comprised of nothing but static content.\n\nEnterprise systems designer [Craig Buckler](http://craigbuckler.com/) offered this definition:\n\n “A Static Site Generator combines content and templates into static HTML files. Generation occurs once and the files can be hosted anywhere without server-side languages, frameworks or other dependencies.”\n\n SSGs compile text-based content files (including markdown or plain text) into HTML pages using templates to determine the layout of the page. The rendered site can then be uploaded to a server, remaining unchanged until the next time the SSG is run, making it ideal for sites that don’t require regular modification.\n\nBecause of the way SSGs work, they make ideal companions for headless content management systems, which can handle the heavy content lifting while the SSG acts as the delivery layer.\n\nTheir simplicity and agility make them a good solution for enterprises looking to deploy microsites and landing pages. However, they can slow projects down if the site in question is particularly large or image-heavy — [as explained by web architect Stefan Baumgartner](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/using-a-static-site-generator-at-scale-lessons-learned/).\n\nPros and Cons of Static Site Generators\n---------------------------------------\n\n### Pros\n\n- **Site Speed:** SSGs don’t require databases, nor do they rely on server-side script processing. You can put a static site on a CDN and let it quickly be consumed worldwide\n- **Flexibility:** Developers generally love the flexibility of SSGs because changing the layout or adding another microsite to the content does not require going deep into the internals of the content management system. You’re generally free from traditional content management system constraints\n- **Security:** Thanks to the simplistic nature of a static site, hackers and malware bots have fewer loose ends to exploit. Not having any database or any dynamic interpreter running on your servers reduces the risk of hacks\n- **Managed Publishing Cycles:** Storing all of the technology parts as well as the content in a version-control system such as Git allows for a flexible publishing cycle. Preparing content in a branch, merging it on demand and putting it out on the servers entails just a few clicks\n\n### Cons\n\n- **Slow at Scale:** Because SSGs render entire sites at once, larger sites can take a very long time to initially deploy. Thus, they aren’t ideal for large sites\n- **Dynamic Content Is Out:** By definition, static site generators don’t natively support the deployment of dynamic content — which can be an issue if you want your site to have something as simple as a calendar functionality. For such dynamic content, you’ll have to lean on third-party solutions\n- **The Need for Headless:** If you have clients or content editors who are comfortable with coding, you’re safe. But with most content editors being less than tech-savvy, you’ll need a headless or API-driven CMS to help manage your static content more easily\n- **No Database:** Going without a database has its benefits, but it also has its disadvantages. Users can’t search and sort through your site, nor can you add things like a blog or forum.\n\nWhat Is a Flat-File CMS?\n------------------------\n\nA flat-file CMS is also a database-less technology. However, they typically come with user interfaces like admin control panels and WYSIWYG editors, which is ideal for less technical marketers and agencies dealing with hands-on clients.\n\nWe turned once more to Buckler for a definition:\n\n “A flat-file CMS allows you to edit website content through a user interface. Most traditional CMS store page data in a database but a flat-file CMS uses files instead. Server code combines content with a template when the page is requested, \\[unlike SSGs, which serve pages from one initial rendering\\].”\n\n Flat-file content management systems allow for heightened speed, simplicity, mobility and security. Plus, because they come with a UI, they are an approachable solution for the less technical.\n\nPros and Cons of Flat-File CMSs\n-------------------------------\n\n### Pros\n\n- **Faster Initial Deployment:** There’s no database, so all you really need is a cloud or locally hosted environment and an FTP client to deploy a site. Plus, because flat-files sites aren’t rendered wholesale like SSG-powered sites, initial deployment is typically faster\n- **Site Speed:** Like SSGs, the absence of database queries helps flat-file CMS load sites faster\n- **Lightweight and Portable:** Flat-file platforms are typically very small in size. So moving flat-file projects from server to server is easier\n- **Version Controlling:** Flat-file CMS can be version controlled via GitHub and its competitors, which comes with all the associated collaboration and workflow benefits\n\n### Cons\n\n\n- **Smaller Communities:** Flat-file solutions never quite get as much attention as SSGs, and this is unlikely to change thanks to various headless CMS vendors recommending SSGs to their clients. Thus, the flat-file community and resulting support is more sparse\n- **Not as Fast:** Because flat-file CMS driven sites are rendered upon request, they take slightly longer to load for users in comparison to SSG-powered sites\n- **No Database:** Like with SSGs, you pay the price for going without a database. That means you can’t give users the ability to search and sort through your site, nor can you add more technical dimensions to your site, like a blog or forum.\n\n\n\nHow to Choose Between Flat-file CMS vs. Static Site Generators\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you’re still struggling to choose between a flat-file CMS and a static site generator, Buckler highlighted the differences.  \n  \n “The primary difference between the two, is that a flat-file CMS provides a user interface, while a SSG is a developer tool with no interface other than the command line,” he said.\n\n“However, the distinction is not always clear and the two technologies can share certain benefits. For example, a flat-file CMS could potentially run locally and use SSG techniques to render static HTML files prior to upload. Similarly, a static site generator could extract page content generated from any flat-file CMS (or indeed, any database-driven CMS).”\n\nTo sum up, a flat-file CMS is typically best suited for agencies with hands-on clients and content editors who require a user interface to produce content. SSGs on the other hand, are ideal for developers who want small, snappy websites, or who are hunting for a delivery layer to accompany their headless CMS.\n\n **[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com)** is bridging the GAP between Static Site Generators and Flat File CMS Systems. \nThe days when a brand only needed one website to house its online presence are long gone.

        "content": "\n## **A Little Background**\n\nThere’s been a lot of talk recently about [STATIC SITES](http://app.webriq.com/sites/create) and the new generation of tools used to create them,commonly referred to as “**static site generators**” or “**static site engines**.” As with any new technology, it can sometimes be hard to differentiate the hype from the reality. In a series of blog post aims to give you a broad understanding of the technology: what it is and whereit best applies. First, however,we need to define what static sites are and where they came from.\n\nThe term “static site” is an interesting one if you think about it, as it defines itself by what it lacks. The “static” aspect doesn’t so much describe a feature as the absence of one: dynamic page rendering. Once upon a time, probably before we commonly used the term “static site,” this would have been considered a weakness.\n\nThose of us who’ve been working in web development for some time probably recall building static sites using tools like Dreamweaver, HomeSite, or(heaven forbid) FrontPage. The content on these pages could only be changed by manually altering the existing site files and replacing the files onthe server via FTP.\n\nThere were a number of issues with this process. Adding content to the site required a moderately high level of technical knowledge, either knowledge of the specific tool used to design and build the site or of HTML to hand code the site. One also needed to understand how to deploy the site to a host via FTP, which isn’t necessarily straightforward for non technical users. This meant that the content creators, who are frequently non technical, could not directly or easily contribute to the site and required the assistance of a webdeveloper to add new content.\n\nCreating new pages typically required copying and tweaking existing pages. As the site grew, maintaining proper navigation and links typically became both tedious and extremely error prone. Some tools offered features like templates that tried to solve these issues, but these could be complicated or cumbersome to create.\n\nIn addition to these issues, there was the limitation that if your site required dynamic features like comments or forums, for example, this was simply not possible in a pure static site.\n\n## The Dynamic Site Era\n\nDynamic sites seemed to fix these issues. Non technical content creators could create and update pages via backend forms without the need to understand the specifics of website development tools or HTML. Since the content and pages were all driven from a database, navigation could be generated automatically. In addition, by definition, dynamic sites allow for dynamic features such as forums or comments.\n\nIn the case of content-focused web pages, dynamic sites often took the form of a content management system (CMS). These could be custom built to the needs of the site or, very frequently, selected from a number of commercial or open source options.\n\nTo this day, most of the content published on the Web runs through some form of content management system. Popular open source options include [Drupal,](http://drupal.com/) [Joomla,](http://www.joomla.org/)and [Typo3](http://typo3.org/) or [WebriQ CMS](http://www.webtools2go.com/). Nowadays, these systems typically handle much more than simply content creation and publication, with features such as complex roles and access control, workflow management, document management, and syndication.\n\nThese additional features lead to the biggest issue with dynamic sites, which is that the solution is often more complex than the problem. By virtue of its need to cater to a broad set of customers, a pre-built CMS often has a steep learning curve for both developers and content creators. Meanwhile, a custom CMS requires both extensive development efforts and access to a developer should issues or necessary changes arise.\n\nHosting dynamic sites is complicated by the need for database storage (and backups) as well as support for whatever dynamic language the site is built upon (PHP,Ruby, etc.). Factor in the need for regular updates to the dynamic language, database solution and even the CMS software itself, and it becomes rather obvious that, while dynamic sites solve many difficult problems, they bring with them their own set of complications.\n\n## The Rise of Blog Engines\n\nThe complexity of content management systems was not well suited for smaller, content-focused sites or blogs that didn’t require advanced features like complex user roles or workflow. Blogging engines, the most popular being [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org), aimed to solve this by making development simple, with pre-built and easily customizable templates, and publishing content quick and easy.\n\nBlog engines don’t negate the need for supporting a dynamic language(PHPin the case of WordPress) or for a database(typically MySQL for WordPress). WordPress, however, became popular enough that many hosts made “out-of-the-box” hosting solutions that simplified set up and maintenance. To give you a sense of the popularity of WordPress, [according to W3Techs,](http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all/) as of May 2015, Wordpress is used on approximately 23.9% of the top 10 million sites, a percentage that dwarfs every other content management system.\n\nNonetheless, overtime, WordPress has begun to gain some of the complexity of a typical CMS, and it is generally lumped in the category of CMS by most industry research. Many sites heavily depend on features that are added via plug-ins, the [quantity and quality of](http://wpengine.com/2013/08/28/plugins-and-fast-wordpress-sites-its-not-the-number-of-plugins-its-the-quality/) which can dramatically impact site performance.(http://wpengine.com/2013/08/28/plugins-and-fast-wordpress-sites-its-not-the-number-of-plugins-its-the-quality/. In addition, features like plug-ins and [“shortcodes”can](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode) impact the portability of content, keeping your site tied to the Wordpress platform.\n\nSome in the blogging community felt that Wordpress and competing blog engines like [MoveableTypehad](https://movabletype.org/) strayed so far from the simplicity of their initial blogging focus that they created new projects, like [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) , that aimed to get back to the basics of just blogging. Ghost’s tagline is, in fact, “Justa blogging platform.”\n\n## Static Pages Get A New Life\n\nWhatever complexity dynamic sites may bring, for most use cases, there is simply no avoiding the need for dynamic data. Even the most basic content site, like a personal blog, generally has dynamic aspects: commenting, feedback or contact forms and search, to name just a few. So it wasn’t until the rise of new services that can fill these voids that static sites really became a viable option of rmore than just [“brochureware”.](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/brochureware)\n\nThere are numerous services, both free and paid, that offer the ability to add dynamic aspects into static pages (it’simportant to note that these services are not specifically intended for use only on static sites). Some popular options include:\n\n • [Disqus,](https://disqus.com/) [Livefyre,](http://web.livefyre.com/comments/) or [Facebook for](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments) comments\n\n• [Wufooor](http://www.wufoo.com/) or [Google for](http://www.google.com/forms/about/) forms\n\n• [Google,](https://cse.google.com/cse/) [Swiftype,](https://swiftype.com/) or [AddSearch for](http://www.addsearch.com/) search\n\n• [Discourse for](http://www.discourse.org/) forums\n\nThere are many more covering a full range of typical site requirements. There even BaaS(backend as a service) solutions like [Parseor](https://parse.com/), [Kinveyth](http://www.kinvey.com/) that offer APIs that allow developers to pull any form of arbitrary dynamic data into a static page.\n\nIf you’re interested in some of the services listed above as well as implementations, read an article on the topic called [“Movingto](http://modernweb.com/2013/12/16/moving-to-static-and-keeping-your-toys/)[Staticand Keeping YourToys”.](http://modernweb.com/2013/12/16/moving-to-static-and-keeping-your-toys/)\n\n## Defining a Static Website\n\nSo far we’ve covered some background showing how the static web pages of old failed to meet the needs of the Web as websites became more complex and interactive. We discussed how dynamic sites generally and content management systems specifically solved some of these problems but led to increased complexity in both development and authoring. Blog engines partially addressed these issues but also took on some of the complexity over time. Finally, we saw how the rise of services have helped make static pages a viable option again.\n\n### Given all the above, what is a Static Website exactly \n\nThis is probably the key defining characteristic of a static site and part of why static sites tend to perform so well: there is no server-side generation at runtime. This means, for instance, that every visitor to your static site will be served an identical copy of _index.html_ from the server until it is manually overwritten, say by uploading a new file or by committing to a Github repository. \n\n _There is no server-side language._\n\nIt follows from the preceding characteristic that there would be no server-side language (like Ruby or PHP for example) involved.\n\n _Thereis no database._\n\nAs there is no server-side language to speak to a database, there is therefore no database. This does not mean that there is no data. There can be data stored as files or via an external service like the ones discussed earlier. This means that if you need common features like user registration/login, this would need to be via an external service.\n\n _Static sites are HTML,_ _CSS, and JavaScript._\n\nThis seems fairly obvious, but it should be clear that since static sites are intended to run in the browser, they must rely on web technologies to function. Of course, this can also include images like JPEG and GIF, graphic files like SVG and WebGL, or data formats like JSON or XML.\n\n## Benefits of Static Sites\n\nWhile each of the preceding features brings with it certain limitations, they also lead to some of the primary benefits of static sites:\n\n _Performance_\n\nThere is no server-side processing and no database to connect to, meaning that there is nothing to slow down getting a static page from the server to your end user. This also means that there are no bottlenecks that might cause slowness or outages should you encounter a significant traffic surge.\n\n _Hosting_\n\nSince no server-side language is required, hosting requires no complicated setup or maintenance, making it cheap and easy. In fact, there are even free options, like [GitHub pages or](https://pages.github.com/) [Surge,](https://surge.sh/) for instance. Hosting and deployment will be covered in follow onposts. \n\n _Security_\n\nThere are no server-side language issues to exploit and no database to hack. Basically, as long as the files on your host are secure, your static site is secure.\n\n_Content versioning_\n\nSince your entire site, from configuration to content, is file-based, it is very easy to keep all aspects of it within a version control system like Git. This can be especially advantageous for things like documentation that you may want to allow community contributions, forexample, using pull requests on GitHub.\n\n**To be continued in later posts.**\n\nGet a sneak preview on [WebriQ's Web Content Management System for Static websites](http://app.webriq.com/sites/create) or just go through a [QUICK DEMO](http://app.webriq.com/help/page/demo/howto)\n\n**This post is an extract from the Book by Brian Rinaldi – Static Site **Generators.**** ",

In a series of blog post aims to give you a broad understanding of the technology: what it is and whereit best applies. First, however,we need to define what static sites are and where they came from.\n\nThe term “static site” is an interesting one if you think about it, as it defines itself by what it lacks. The “static” aspect doesn’t so much describe a feature as the absence of one: dynamic page rendering. Once upon a time, probably before we commonly used the term “static site,” this would have been considered a weakness.\n\nThose of us who’ve been working in web development for some time probably recall building static sites using tools like Dreamweaver, HomeSite, or(heaven forbid) FrontPage. The content on these pages could only be changed by manually altering the existing site files and replacing the files onthe server via FTP.\n\nThere were a number of issues with this process. Adding content to the site required a moderately high level of technical knowledge, either knowledge of the specific tool used to design and build the site or of HTML to hand code the site. One also needed to understand how to deploy the site to a host via FTP, which isn’t necessarily straightforward for non technical users. This meant that the content creators, who are frequently non technical, could not directly or easily contribute to the site and required the assistance of a webdeveloper to add new content.\n\nCreating new pages typically required copying and tweaking existing pages. As the site grew, maintaining proper navigation and links typically became both tedious and extremely error prone. Some tools offered features like templates that tried to solve these issues, but these could be complicated or cumbersome to create.\n\nIn addition to these issues, there was the limitation that if your site required dynamic features like comments or forums, for example, this was simply not possible in a pure static site.\n\n## The Dynamic Site Era\n\nDynamic sites seemed to fix these issues. Non technical content creators could create and update pages via backend forms without the need to understand the specifics of website development tools or HTML. Since the content and pages were all driven from a database, navigation could be generated automatically. In addition, by definition, dynamic sites allow for dynamic features such as forums or comments.\n\nIn the case of content-focused web pages, dynamic sites often took the form of a content management system (CMS). These could be custom built to the needs of the site or, very frequently, selected from a number of commercial or open source options.\n\nTo this day, most of the content published on the Web runs through some form of content management system. Popular open source options include [Drupal,](http://drupal.com/) [Joomla,](http://www.joomla.org/)and [Typo3](http://typo3.org/) or [WebriQ CMS](http://www.webtools2go.com/). Nowadays, these systems typically handle much more than simply content creation and publication, with features such as complex roles and access control, workflow management, document management, and syndication.\n\nThese additional features lead to the biggest issue with dynamic sites, which is that the solution is often more complex than the problem. By virtue of its need to cater to a broad set of customers, a pre-built CMS often has a steep learning curve for both developers and content creators. Meanwhile, a custom CMS requires both extensive development efforts and access to a developer should issues or necessary changes arise.\n\nHosting dynamic sites is complicated by the need for database storage (and backups) as well as support for whatever dynamic language the site is built upon (PHP,Ruby, etc.). Factor in the need for regular updates to the dynamic language, database solution and even the CMS software itself, and it becomes rather obvious that, while dynamic sites solve many difficult problems, they bring with them their own set of complications.\n\n## The Rise of Blog Engines\n\nThe complexity of content management systems was not well suited for smaller, content-focused sites or blogs that didn’t require advanced features like complex user roles or workflow. Blogging engines, the most popular being [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org), aimed to solve this by making development simple, with pre-built and easily customizable templates, and publishing content quick and easy.\n\nBlog engines don’t negate the need for supporting a dynamic language(PHPin the case of WordPress) or for a database(typically MySQL for WordPress). WordPress, however, became popular enough that many hosts made “out-of-the-box” hosting solutions that simplified set up and maintenance.

Many sites heavily depend on features that are added via plug-ins, the [quantity and quality of](http://wpengine.com/2013/08/28/plugins-and-fast-wordpress-sites-its-not-the-number-of-plugins-its-the-quality/) which can dramatically impact site performance.(http://wpengine.com/2013/08/28/plugins-and-fast-wordpress-sites-its-not-the-number-of-plugins-its-the-quality/. In addition, features like plug-ins and [“shortcodes”can](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode) impact the portability of content, keeping your site tied to the Wordpress platform.\n\nSome in the blogging community felt that Wordpress and competing blog engines like [MoveableTypehad](https://movabletype.org/) strayed so far from the simplicity of their initial blogging focus that they created new projects, like [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) , that aimed to get back to the basics of just blogging.

You can go along with a static HTML internet site or a Content Management System (CMS) which include WordPress or Joomla. If you’re new to constructing and coping with web sites, then you might wonder what the huge difference is among these two tactics. They both make best websites, however, there may be an international of distinction on the way you get to the cease end result. Read onto discover the difference among them, and which one is really great for you.\n\n### HTML – CSS – JavaScript\n\nA static HTML website is one which you construct with HTML and CSS. The cause it’s referred to as a static internet site is because nothing can alternate about the website or as a minimum no longer except you go back and exchange the code. Up till latest years, this becomes honestly the only way to make a website. There is no dynamic content, neither is there any actual consumer interaction. The only factor you get is what you input into the HTML. What does that suggest? Simply placed, after you are performed with the design and installation the internet site it will most effective do what you requested it to. You can make stunning web sites that allow the users to examine the content material, purchase merchandise, access to unfastened gives, sign on for newsletters and build your listing. Just approximately something your choice you can do with a static HTML internet site.\n\nThough it is known as an HTML internet site, there are absolutely several exceptional coding languages generally used to construct an HTML website. List of basic HTML tags presents the shape or the core, but CSS is used to set the appearance and feel for the visuals and to make an appearance pretty too. You can set the dimensions, colors, fonts, backgrounds… And many others. JavaScript may be used to feature computer graphics to the internet site and even a touch dynamic interplay with the user. As you can believe though, in case you pick out to go this direction to create your internet site you’ll want to recognize at least the basics of each of the languages used.\n\n\n### WordPress or Joomla?\n\nThis is, in reality, a count of desire. Both are very good systems and for the maximum component, one is as clean to apply as the opposite. The biggest distinction among them is this: SEO WordPress has been around since 2003 and is very famous. As an end result, they get a huge amount of support from other programmers on the subject of Plugins (we’re going to talk about that is a minute) and search engine marketing, and there are a kazillion issues available for WordPress too, therefore making it a very popular desire for each rookies and pros alike. Joomla has not been around as long (2005) however has become very popular in its own right over the years. It is second handiest to WordPress and with over 30 million downloads and now with WordPress integration, it is no slouch. Both permit customers to depart comments to posts and or pages, circulate new content material from resources like social media or news websites and you could additionally quick add new posts to your blog without having to fear approximately editing your navigation bar (it’s computerized) or structuring your pages, thanks to built-in templates.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\nStatic HTML: Pros – A static HTML internet site is straightforward to setup (especially if you understand code). You have complete manipulate of the layout, appearance, and feel. HTML best websites also have a tendency to load faster due to the fact they usually have fewer documents and information to download. As said in advance, a large gain of HTML is that you have total manipulate over the internet site’s appearance. You can trade the visuals of a WordPress or Joomla website online too, but you’re restrained via the amount of choices or flexibility available with the topic or template you’re the usage of. If you realize CSS, that is a fairly easy language, then you could without difficulty alternate the way your HTML website seems.\n\nStatic HTML: Cons – The cons of static HTML deal with its lack of interactivity and their complex shape with large websites. An HTML page has surely no interactivity and it handiest consists of what you code. For instance, in case you code a Web page with an editorial, then this is all you may get. There can be not anything else at the web page except for that article. There might be no person content, no dynamic content that generates at the same time as you’re away and the website will stay static. On the other hand, in case your software it to consist of a database in order that customers can get entry to the information I bet in a sense you can name that a constrained shape of interactivity. The same holds actual with a shopping cart. A user comes on your internet site buy a products or services you provide; so in the identical experience, they could engage with your internet site in a restricted form.\n\nWordPress Pros – As stated in advance – you could use WordPress or Joomla, but for assessment sake, we’re going to simplest seek advice from WordPress hereafter. WordPress is regularly taken into consideration the first-class manner to setup a website because it’s miles very clean to do and clean for inexperienced persons to parent out. A WordPress blog does make the effort to setup but not when you don’t forget how long it took someone to jot down all of the code required for an HTML web site. Besides, we’re actually talking hours, no longer days or even weeks, but it might no longer be out of the normal for an internet developer to spend days designing a new internet site the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Installing a WordPress blog most effective takes a few minutes with maximum hosts, and including a new theme takes even much less time and subject matters are what WordPress is all about.\n\nLet’s take a minute to talk about topics. Themes or templates permit you to trade the appearance or feel of your website actually in minutes. If you want a particular area of interest web page as an example, a medical looking experience or a golfing theme there are masses to choose from. Some are unfastened and others you will need to buy, typically called Premium topics. If you just need a blog and a place for humans to go away remarks, then a unfastened theme will possibly do the trick. However, in case you want a greater expert or storefront look with maybe a buying cart or an information feed for an Amazon associate, then a top rate topic is the manner to move. I pick premium topics due to the fact they typically permit for greater flexibility and customization.\n\nWordPress Cons – One of the problems with WordPress may be too many plugins. I’ve seen websites that take too long to load and it changed into resulting from having a manner to many plugins established on the web page. Only use what’s vital. Another factor to recollect is the issues. Some are sincerely better than others. Theme developers put plenty of time and idea into the design, but a few developers are certainly thinking of the give up-person greater than others and recognize that we want lots of customization freedom and greater importance, now not each person has programming talents so make it easy to understand and use. All of them allow for some customization, but others will provide you with greater manipulate and the ability to make your internet site appearance the way you actually need it’s. All I’m announcing is to read the critiques and do your homework earlier than making an investment in a top rate subject matter. Also, a well-designed subject matter will look clean and cargo speedy. There are heaps of issues to select from, so you are certain to discover something that you like.\n\n# Solutions WebriQ CMS is bringing to the to the table\n### We have made a choice for you when it comes to Static Website Generators\n**Roots**\n\nRoots is very good at helping to build static front-ends. It is sponsored heavily by Carrot Creative, and makes frequent, highly variable builds quicker and easier for freelancers and agencies. It's a truly excellent framework for quickly and easily building small to medium sized front-ends of any kind.\nRoots can handle a huge number of compiled languages, and can be used with many tools that help push static sites as far as possible. For example, it can link with an API, pull in your data, and render parts of it into your views on compile. Then it can render the same or other views as javascript templates and you can push any other data from your API into them on the fly at runtime on the client side in reaction to user actions. And that's just a small taste of its capabilities. You really can do a lot with static sites, and roots is here to push those limits.\n\n***Why is WebriQ using Roots?***\n\nThe short answer is because roots was built very specifically for static site builds, so it's cleaner and better than general purpose build tools, since it's specialized to that purpose. The longer answer is that it's a qualitative thing. Much like people would ask \"Why should I use snapchat when I can just text a photo\" or \"Why should I use slack when I already have hipchat?\", there is no logical answer other than that the experience is different, and in my opinion, much better -- tailored exactly to what you need. So just try it, and you just might find that you really like it.\n\n\n### We are offering you a GIT Based CMS system with a Complete User Interface\n\n**[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com)** is bridging the GAP between Static Site Generators and Flat File CMS Systems. \nThe days when a brand only needed one website to house its online presence are long gone. Today, webinars, events, pop-up shops and product promotions all require their own microsites or landing pages. \nWhen we moved into what some call the post-CMS landscape, the usage of static site generators and Flat-file CMS and Static Site Generator functionality overlaps in many ways ; so how do you choose between the two? \n\nWhen we moved into what some call the [post-CMS landscape](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/), the usage of static site generators (SSGs) and flat-file CMS for these microsites (and at times for lightweight corporate sites), grew. And now, with the headless CMS hype in full flow, the interest in these front-end solutions is returning.\n\nAfter listing the [best flat-file CMS](http://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/15-flat-file-cms-options-for-lean-website-building/) and the [best static site generators](http://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/15-static-site-generators-to-complement-your-headless-cms/) on offer — it’s time to formally identify what separates these two similar technologies.\n\n### We offer Integrations with Analytics, Content Marketing and Automation Tools inside our APP\n\nOnce you signed up and have your site created on our [APP](http://app.webriq.com) you can freely integrate \n- your Google Analytics account\n- [Upcontent](http://learn.upcontent.com/category/hS7ltwzDri-webriq) Content Curation Content \n- Automation Tool with Zapier - [get your Zapier invite](hhttps://zapier.com/developer/invite/66438/e539ec10196366535f59e7faf8f2638f/ttps://zapier.com/developer/invite/66438/e539ec10196366535f59e7faf8f2638f/).\n\n",

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\nTwo Paths\n======================\n\nThere are essentially two famous techniques to take whilst making a decision to construct an internet site. You can go along with a static HTML internet site or a Content Management System (CMS) which include WordPress or Joomla. If you’re new to constructing and coping with web sites, then you might wonder what the huge difference is among these two tactics. They both make best websites, however, there may be an international of distinction on the way you get to the cease end result. Read onto discover the difference among them, and which one is really great for you.\n\n### HTML – CSS – JavaScript\n\nA static HTML website is one which you construct with HTML and CSS. The cause it’s referred to as a static internet site is because nothing can alternate about the website or as a minimum no longer except you go back and exchange the code. Up till latest years, this becomes honestly the only way to make a website. There is no dynamic content, neither is there any actual consumer interaction. The only factor you get is what you input into the HTML. What does that suggest? Simply placed, after you are performed with the design and installation the internet site it will most effective do what you requested it to. You can make stunning web sites that allow the users to examine the content material, purchase merchandise, access to unfastened gives, sign on for newsletters and build your listing. Just approximately something your choice you can do with a static HTML internet site.\n\nThough it is known as an HTML internet site, there are absolutely several exceptional coding languages generally used to construct an HTML website. List of basic HTML tags presents the shape or the core, but CSS is used to set the appearance and feel for the visuals and to make an appearance pretty too. You can set the dimensions, colors, fonts, backgrounds… And many others. JavaScript may be used to feature computer graphics to the internet site and even a touch dynamic interplay with the user. As you can believe though, in case you pick out to go this direction to create your internet site you’ll want to recognize at least the basics of each of the languages used.\n\n\n### WordPress or Joomla?\n\nThis is, in reality, a count of desire. Both are very good systems and for the maximum component, one is as clean to apply as the opposite. The biggest distinction among them is this: SEO WordPress has been around since 2003 and is very famous. As an end result, they get a huge amount of support from other programmers on the subject of Plugins (we’re going to talk about that is a minute) and search engine marketing, and there are a kazillion issues available for WordPress too, therefore making it a very popular desire for each rookies and pros alike. Joomla has not been around as long (2005) however has become very popular in its own right over the years. It is second handiest to WordPress and with over 30 million downloads and now with WordPress integration, it is no slouch. Both permit customers to depart comments to posts and or pages, circulate new content material from resources like social media or news websites and you could additionally quick add new posts to your blog without having to fear approximately editing your navigation bar (it’s computerized) or structuring your pages, thanks to built-in templates.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\nStatic HTML: Pros – A static HTML internet site is straightforward to setup (especially if you understand code). You have complete manipulate of the layout, appearance, and feel. HTML best websites also have a tendency to load faster due to the fact they usually have fewer documents and information to download. As said in advance, a large gain of HTML is that you have total manipulate over the internet site’s appearance. You can trade the visuals of a WordPress or Joomla website online too, but you’re restrained via the amount of choices or flexibility available with the topic or template you’re the usage of. If you realize CSS, that is a fairly easy language, then you could without difficulty alternate the way your HTML website seems.\n\nStatic HTML: Cons – The cons of static HTML deal with its lack of interactivity and their complex shape with large websites. An HTML page has surely no interactivity and it handiest consists of what you code. For instance, in case you code a Web page with an editorial, then this is all you may get. There can be not anything else at the web page except for that article. There might be no person content, no dynamic content that generates at the same time as you’re away and the website will stay static. On the other hand, in case your software it to consist of a database in order that customers can get entry to the information I bet in a sense you can name that a constrained shape of interactivity. The same holds actual with a shopping cart. A user comes on your internet site buy a products or services you provide; so in the identical experience, they could engage with your internet site in a restricted form.\n\nWordPress Pros – As stated in advance – you could use WordPress or Joomla, but for assessment sake, we’re going to simplest seek advice from WordPress hereafter. WordPress is regularly taken into consideration the first-class manner to setup a website because it’s miles very clean to do and clean for inexperienced persons to parent out. A WordPress blog does make the effort to setup but not when you don’t forget how long it took someone to jot down all of the code required for an HTML web site. Besides, we’re actually talking hours, no longer days or even weeks, but it might no longer be out of the normal for an internet developer to spend days designing a new internet site the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Installing a WordPress blog most effective takes a few minutes with maximum hosts, and including a new theme takes even much less time and subject matters are what WordPress is all about.\n\nLet’s take a minute to talk about topics. Themes or templates permit you to trade the appearance or feel of your website actually in minutes. If you want a particular area of interest web page as an example, a medical looking experience or a golfing theme there are masses to choose from. Some are unfastened and others you will need to buy, typically called Premium topics. If you just need a blog and a place for humans to go away remarks, then a unfastened theme will possibly do the trick. However, in case you want a greater expert or storefront look with maybe a buying cart or an information feed for an Amazon associate, then a top rate topic is the manner to move. I pick premium topics due to the fact they typically permit for greater flexibility and customization.\n\nWordPress Cons – One of the problems with WordPress may be too many plugins. I’ve seen websites that take too long to load and it changed into resulting from having a manner to many plugins established on the web page. Only use what’s vital. Another factor to recollect is the issues. Some are sincerely better than others. Theme developers put plenty of time and idea into the design, but a few developers are certainly thinking of the give up-person greater than others and recognize that we want lots of customization freedom and greater importance, now not each person has programming talents so make it easy to understand and use. All of them allow for some customization, but others will provide you with greater manipulate and the ability to make your internet site appearance the way you actually need it’s. All I’m announcing is to read the critiques and do your homework earlier than making an investment in a top rate subject matter. Also, a well-designed subject matter will look clean and cargo speedy. There are heaps of issues to select from, so you are certain to discover something that you like.\n\n# Solutions WebriQ CMS is bringing to the to the table\n### We have made a choice for you when it comes to Static Website Generators\n**Roots**\n\nRoots is very good at helping to build static front-ends. It is sponsored heavily by Carrot Creative, and makes frequent, highly variable builds quicker and easier for freelancers and agencies. It's a truly excellent framework for quickly and easily building small to medium sized front-ends of any kind.\nRoots can handle a huge number of compiled languages, and can be used with many tools that help push static sites as far as possible. For example, it can link with an API, pull in your data, and render parts of it into your views on compile. Then it can render the same or other views as javascript templates and you can push any other data from your API into them on the fly at runtime on the client side in reaction to user actions. And that's just a small taste of its capabilities. You really can do a lot with static sites, and roots is here to push those limits.\n\n***Why is WebriQ using Roots?***\n\nThe short answer is because roots was built very specifically for static site builds, so it's cleaner and better than general purpose build tools, since it's specialized to that purpose. The longer answer is that it's a qualitative thing. Much like people would ask \"Why should I use snapchat when I can just text a photo\" or \"Why should I use slack when I already have hipchat?\", there is no logical answer other than that the experience is different, and in my opinion, much better -- tailored exactly to what you need. So just try it, and you just might find that you really like it.\n\n\n### We are offering you a GIT Based CMS system with a Complete User Interface\n\n**[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com)** is bridging the GAP between Static Site Generators and Flat File CMS Systems. \nThe days when a brand only needed one website to house its online presence are long gone. Today, webinars, events, pop-up shops and product promotions all require their own microsites or landing pages. \nWhen we moved into what some call the post-CMS landscape, the usage of static site generators and Flat-file CMS and Static Site Generator functionality overlaps in many ways ; so how do you choose between the two? \n\nWhen we moved into what some call the [post-CMS landscape](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/), the usage of static site generators (SSGs) and flat-file CMS for these microsites (and at times for lightweight corporate sites), grew. And now, with the headless CMS hype in full flow, the interest in these front-end solutions is returning.\n\nAfter listing the [best flat-file CMS](http://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/15-flat-file-cms-options-for-lean-website-building/) and the [best static site generators](http://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/15-static-site-generators-to-complement-your-headless-cms/) on offer — it’s time to formally identify what separates these two similar technologies.\n\n### We offer Integrations with Analytics, Content Marketing and Automation Tools inside our APP\n\nOnce you signed up and have your site created on our [APP](http://app.webriq.com) you can freely integrate \n- your Google Analytics account\n- [Upcontent](http://learn.upcontent.com/category/hS7ltwzDri-webriq) Content Curation Content \n- Automation Tool with Zapier - [get your Zapier invite](hhttps://zapier.com/developer/invite/66438/e539ec10196366535f59e7faf8f2638f/ttps://zapier.com/developer/invite/66438/e539ec10196366535f59e7faf8f2638f/).\n\n",

A website back then was a folder of HTML documents that consisted of [just 18 tags](http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html). Browsers were simple document navigators that would fetch HTML from a server and allow the end user to navigate them by following hyperlinks. The web was fundamentally static.\n\nAs browsers evolved, so did HTML, and gradually the limitations of purely static websites started to show.\n\nThe most mainstream answer to the limitations of Static Websites was the LAMP stack and CMS’ such as WordPress, Drupal and Joomla. All of these played an incredibly important role in moving the web forward, enabling the Web 2.0 phenomenon, in which user-generated content became a driving factor for a lot of websites. Users went from following hyperlinks to ordering products, participating in communities and creating content.\n\n## Dynamic Website Wordpress Problems<br><br>\n\nThe dynamic website architecture moved the web forward, but it also opened a can of worms. By a conservative estimate, more than 70% of today’s WordPress installations are vulnerable to known exploits (and WordPress powers more than 23% of the web). Just a few months ago, [12 million Drupal sites needed emergency patching](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/10/30/millions-of-drupal-websites-at-risk-from-failure-to-patch/), and any not patched within 7 hours of the exploits’ announcement should be considered infected with malware.. Not a week goes by when I don’t follow a link from social media to a website that shows a “Database connection error.” Scaling a dynamic website can be very expensive, and agencies that launch a campaign website or the like often have to overprovision drastically in order to guard against the website blowing up if it manages to go viral — or else they have to desperately scale it while trying to get it back online (something that never seems to happen during office hours).\n\nWe pay a huge price for the underlying complexity of dynamic code running on a server for every request — a price we could avoid paying entirely when this kind of complexity is not needed.\n\n## Is Static the next big thing again and why now?<br><br>\n\nWhy is static website technology taking off now, and why did the early generators fail to make a dent in WordPress’ dominance? What’s changed? And how far can we take this?\n\nToday’s static website tools play into a totally different ecosystem than their predecessors. Many of the constraints that made dynamic websites the best option for creating anything but the most basic online brochure have fallen away. \n\n### THE BROWSER IS GROWING UP\n\nWhen Tim Berners-Lee launched the first website of the World Wide Web, a browser was a simple document viewer that could display hypertext, links and little else.\n\nToday, we’re finally in the process of burying the last browser that has been holding the web back (RIP Internet Explorer 8). The modern browser is an operating system in its own right, no longer merely displaying documents downloaded from the web, but capable of running full-fledged web applications, making external calls to API, storing data locally, opening WebSockets to streaming servers, and even handling peer-to-peer connections to other browsers via WebRTC.\n\nWith the maturation of browsers, many features that used to require dynamic code running on a server can be moved entirely to the client. Want comments on your website? Add Disqus, Isso or Facebook comments. Want social integration? Add Twitter or Facebook’s JavaScript widget to your website. Want real-time data updating live on your website? Add a squirt of Firebase. Want search? Add Swiftype. Want to add live chat support? Slaaks is there. \n\nThe list goes on and on, as a whole ecosystem of purely browser-based add-ons to websites is emerging.\n\n### THE CDN IS GOING MAINSTREAM\n\nWhen Akamai launched the first content delivery network in 1999, only the largest web properties in the world could afford to deliver their web assets from CDN edge nodes distributed all over the world. It wasn’t that long ago that CDNs were used only by companies at the scale of CNN and Facebook, rather than mere mortals.\n\nWhile Akamai still has enterprise-level pricing, today anyone can sign up for Amazon AWS and put CloudFront on top of their website. Also, companies like Fastly, MaxCDN and CloudFlare offer CDN services at prices that even a small business can afford.\n\nA static website can be readily deployed directly to a CDN and served straight from local caches near end users. Fiddling with the configuration still takes some time, and cache invalidation can be tricky, but it’s doable and can be completely automated with services such as [ours](http://www.webfactories.biz/pricing)\n\n### PERFORMANCE IS A MUST\n\nThe explosion of mobile devices has changed the face of the web in many ways. More and more visitors are coming to the web from a mobile device, sometimes on a 3G connection. Never has performance been as important as it is now.\n\nWe all know this data: 57% of online visitors will abandon a page if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. People used to be willing to wait up to 10 seconds, but expectations are way higher today. And on mobile, where there’s no multi-tasking and little else to do, waiting for a website to load is so frustrating that more than 4% of people report that they’ve physically thrown their phone while using a slow mobile website!\n\nNo matter how much you optimize a dynamic website for performance or how many thousand of dollars you throw at it, it will never give you the same basic performance guarantee as a well-tuned static website hosted right on a CDN for a few bucks a month. With performance constantly growing in importance, it’s no wonder that developers are looking for ways to pre-generate their HTML, instead of letting the server spend time and resources on generating a page for every single HTTP request.\n\nStatic website generation also eliminates a lot of performance concerns during the development process.\n\nIf you’re building a dynamic database-driven website, the efficiency of the database queries you’re making is extremely important because they’ll need to be fast enough to run once for every single HTTP request. Even if a solid caching layer lies on top of your website, there’s often a risk that some requests will effectively work as cache-busters, triggering worst-case queries in the back end and causing the whole system to grind to a halt.\n\nWith a static-generated website, it doesn’t matter much if pulling content into a template takes a few seconds more or less: That only happens when you publish, and there will never be a performance penalty for end users.\n\n## The Final piece of the Puzzle<br><br>\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle, however, is content editing. While working directly in Markdown in a text editor and pushing to GitHub is close to the ideal workflow for a front-end developer, it’s not something you’d get normal, non-technical end user to participate in. \n\nSystems such as [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), [Prismic.io](https://prismic.io/) and [GatherContent](https://gathercontent.com/) decouple the CMS layer from the actual website builder. This makes them really interesting tools for multi-channel content management, where you’re writing content not just for a particular website, but also for a mobile app, a Facebook page or a white paper. Publishing new content triggers a webhook in a build system; then, a static website generator runs the build and fetches data from the content API; and the result is pushed straight to a CDN.\n\nThe ultimate answer is an open-source Static CMS system without any lock-in to a particular static website generator, Git host or hosting platform. It will be a great way to push the limit of what kind of website you can build with modern static website technology.\n\nHere is a initial attempt to tackle a Static CMS system\n[WebriQ Static Web CMS Application](http://app.webriq.com/auth/register)\n  ",

For some time we have recognized the value of using static websites and wanted to provide some insight into the practical choices made when evaluating the suitability of the static website approach.\n\n When discussing static websites, most people respond \"Why? Why should I make this website static?\", but instead the question should be *Why should my website be Dynamic or driven by a database?*\n\n STATIC OR DYNAMIC WEBSITE\n\nThe term _static site_ describes a website with pre-existing content and available as plain HTML files. This is in contrast to a _dynamic site_ in which content is generated upon request by a series of backend systems, essentially a database.\n\n All sites have some static content: the images, [the styling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_(web_development)), etc... For dynamic sites the HTML markup that brings all of it together is not already available for use, rather it is generated at the time it is needed by a browser. In contrast, a static website has this markup pre-generated and immediately ready to be sent to a browser without delay, having already performed the generation step before the site was made available. \n\n Not taking the performance hit of generating the site content upon request spares the burden of [real-time infrastructure](http://c179631.r31.cf0.rackcdn.com/diagram_scalablewordpress.png), which translates directly to sites exhibiting greater speed and stability [at significantly lower costs](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/). The absence of this complex infrastructure results in sites that are more secure and scalable. Cloud hosting has made it such that for almost negligible cost a static website will never be unavailable and can scale to meet any perceivable demand. Static site generation was [one of the techniques](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2013/10/24/its-called-jekyll/)used to save the [healthcare.gov website](https://www.healthcare.gov/) when it had trouble scaling in it's initial rollout.\n\n WHEN TO USE A STATIC WEBSITE\n\nAs the [LAMP stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) , i.e Wordpress and it's lookalikes grew in popularity, its use in creating websites became common and many sites that did not have particular needs to be dynamic were created **dynamic by default**. This is not the best approach.\n\n Imagine you have a website that presents widget information, and you have 1000 widgets in your database. It would be easy to default to creating a dynamic website with a script taking the widget name as input and displaying specific information about that widget when the site was hit. An alternative is to use a static website generator to create the 1000 different pages (one for each widget) and use those to show the widget information. If the widgets ever update, the site may be re-generated to update the content. Now that static website generators have the capability to effortlessly rebuild websites around new content, adding new content to static websites may be configured to as a turnkey operation.\n\n It may require creative thought as to how to turn a website that would be obviously dynamic into a static website. At the same time, never before has there been this many quality tools for adding dynamic _elements_ to otherwise static websites. Now that [the Google Crawler is executing JavaScript](http://searchengineland.com/tested-googlebot-crawls-javascript-heres-learned-220157) as part of content indexing, the traditional major penalty of this approach has been removed.\n\n See the aforementioned article for greater [details on the process of static website generation](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/).\n\n Generally you should be striving to make your website as static and compressed as possible, while recognizing there are some good reasons it may not be possible:\n\nINFORMATION UPDATE FREQUENCY\n\nThe information you are trying to convey on your website may require real-time generation to display. If you _must_ display content information accurate to the moment the request for the information was made, it would not be possible to pre-generate the content as you would not know what the information actually is at the time of site generation.\n\n This is not to say that generation cannot be frequent if the data changes frequently. If you have a data set such that generating (and deploying) the site takes 60 seconds, and the data changes every 10 minutes. You still have the opportunity to automate site generation every 10 minutes and have a static website that is relatively current to the information it is conveying.\n\n If real-time data is of absolute importance, then something like a microservice utilizing client side JavaScript to retrieve the most current information may be used in conjunction with a static website. Possible with some technical creativity.\n\nPERSONALIZATION\n\nIf the page you display is completely customized to your user it would not be possible to pre-generate the pages as you would need authentication and then customization information that is only available at the time of the request. Again, this may be mitigated by using client-side JavaScript to provide some of the personalizing.\n\nEASE-OF-USE\n\nIt makes sense to use a WordPress blog or other service if you simply do not have the expertise to use the generating tools. In these cases the value is not provided by the dynamic generation of the website, but the interfaces give by the CMS tools to customize the site, requiring that the site be able to feed from a dynamic infrastructure stack.\n\n MAKING THE DECISION TO GO STATIC\n\nEXAMPLE: THE WORDPRESS SITE\n\nWordPress has become a often requested platform for websites. It is requested due to positive word-of-mouth and adoption rates, but rarely is it analyzed beforehand as the proper approach for a site's needs.\n\n The site requirements were a completely custom design, lots of static text, some data (not altering for the forseeable future), more of a classic corporate home-page, in [single-page website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) format.\n\n While it is possible to build this site on WordPress, it did not make a lot of sense. We instead suggested a static site, and built it with a tool chain readily available in the [WEBRIQ APP](http://app.webriq.com/auth/register/). The site uses client-side JavaScript UI to retrieve and display own and third-party data, adding a more dynamic feel. The end result was a site that fulfilled the requirements, is editable by anyone who knows Text editing, is lightning fast to deliver and is hosted on a Content Delivery Network, with a 100% uptime.\n\n EXAMPLE: THE CONTENT AGGREGATOR\n\nThis looked, initially, like a standard dynamically generated website. The site was a content aggregator, displaying news from a few third party websites, with some extra value-add information.\n\n After analyzing the requirements, we saw opportunities in the nature of the aggregated data\n\n* We only needed to display the top 50 or so items from each site.\n* The sites did not exhibit much data churn within the span of an hour.\n What we saw here was that the overall site itself was static, the data was the only changing portion and that only needed to change on an hourly basis. After some quick prototyping, we found a good static approach. The website itself is statically generated, and the data is generated hourly into a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file which generates a webhook to automatically create a new build for the site. JavaScript is used on the client to display the content in the JSON file and add customization via meta data added as part of the aggregation process. \n\n###  **TOOLS**\n\nSome of the tools we use in creating static sites:\n\nROOTS \n\nRoots is a static site compiler, that generates static html, css, and javascript files. It's very good at helping to build static front-ends. It is sponsored heavily by [**Carrot Creative**](http://carrot.is/), and makes frequent, highly variable builds quicker and easier for freelancers and agencies. It's a truly excellent framework for quickly and easily building small to medium sized front-ends of any kind.\n\nRoots can handle a huge number of compiled languages, and can be used with many tools that help push static sites as far as possible. For example, it can link with an API, pull in your data, and render parts of it into your views on compile. Then it can render the same or other views as javascript templates and you can push any other data from your API into them on the fly at runtime on the client side in reaction to user actions. \n\n\nGITHUB\n\nUsed to host all your HTML, CSS, Javascript and other assets for continuous deployment of your site. Each time your site has been updated with a new page, new content or new style a webhook will automatically start a new deployment process. The update process typically takes around 10 to 20 seconds, and you will be notified when the new build is ready. The repository approach has two other major benefits - you can revert to previous builds if needed and you can invite a series of collaborators to the repository for updating style sheets, pages and/or content. \n\nSTATIC CMS SYSTEM\n\nA JavaScript based CMS for static site generators. It gives non-technical users a simple way to edit and add content to any site built with a static site generator, in this case Roots. \nThe CMS is a single-page app that you pull into the /admin part of your site.\n\nIt presents a clean UI for editing content stored in a Git repository. As an example [WebriQ Blog Admin](http://blog.webriq.com/admin) \n\nYou setup a config to describe the content model of your site, and typically tweak the main layout of the CMS a bit to fit your own site.\n\nWhen a user navigates to /admin she'll be prompted to login with a Github credential, and once authenticated she'll be able to create new content or edit existing content.\n\nRegister a [FREE ACCOUNT](http://app.webriq.com/auth/regsiter/) to see all the above tools and much more in action.\n\n\n",

For some time we have recognized the value of using static websites and wanted to provide some insight into the practical choices made when evaluating the suitability of the static website approach.\n\n When discussing static websites, most people respond \"Why? Why should I make this website static?\", but instead the question should be *Why should my website be Dynamic or driven by a database?*\n\n STATIC OR DYNAMIC WEBSITE\n\nThe term _static site_ describes a website with pre-existing content and available as plain HTML files. This is in contrast to a _dynamic site_ in which content is generated upon request by a series of backend systems, essentially a database.\n\n All sites have some static content: the images, [the styling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_(web_development)), etc... For dynamic sites the HTML markup that brings all of it together is not already available for use, rather it is generated at the time it is needed by a browser. In contrast, a static website has this markup pre-generated and immediately ready to be sent to a browser without delay, having already performed the generation step before the site was made available. \n\n Not taking the performance hit of generating the site content upon request spares the burden of [real-time infrastructure](http://c179631.r31.cf0.rackcdn.com/diagram_scalablewordpress.png), which translates directly to sites exhibiting greater speed and stability [at significantly lower costs](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/). The absence of this complex infrastructure results in sites that are more secure and scalable. Cloud hosting has made it such that for almost negligible cost a static website will never be unavailable and can scale to meet any perceivable demand.

But WordPress and its peers still have a number of moving parts. This is overkill for someone who just wants to blog while still **owning** it. A recent answer to this is the **static site generator (SSG)**. Let’s explore why you might want to consider one for your next online project.\n\nWhat Is a Static Site Generator?\n--------------------------------\n\nThe first pages on the Web were just that: individual pages that someone wrote as an HTML file and uploaded to a server. While a modern CMS (Content Management System) presents content as a page, in reality it is mashing up markup, database content, and real-time calculations. They are web applications that help users create content, store it, then serve it up to site visitors.\n\nIn contrast, static site generators are publishing tools. They’re not so different from tools like Adobe Acrobat, which takes an editable format (e.g. Microsoft Word) and [converts it to a format](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-free-online-pdf-tools-save-lot-work/)   [7 Free Online PDF Tools That Could Save You A Lot Of Work](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-free-online-pdf-tools-save-lot-work/)     [7 Free Online PDF Tools That Could Save You A Lot Of Work](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-free-online-pdf-tools-save-lot-work/) The Web is full of awesome little tools that can help you alter PDF files without breaking a sweat. Let's look at lesser known PDF tasks that may come in handy for you. [Read More](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-free-online-pdf-tools-save-lot-work/)   that’s easy to consume (.PDF). In this case, SSGs are doing the following basic tasks:\n\n1. Taking some sort of basic content as input;\n2. Creating nice-looking web content from it, and;\n3. Helping to push that content live to the web.\n\nIn the next section we’ll examine some of the advantages the “static” nature of SSGs provides over today’s CMSs.\n\nAdvantages of Using a Static Site Generator\n-------------------------------------------\n\nFor those used to working in a CMS like WordPress, some of the following will seem like a big change. But they make producing and maintaining some types of sites a lot easier. Let’s take a look at some of these advantages.\n\n_The below sections include commands and output from the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator as an example. If you select a different SSG, the commands will be different, but the concepts are similar._\n\n### 1. Static Sites Don’t Require Complex Installations\n\nA major difference compared to a “traditional” CMS is that you’re installing static site generators on your **local** machine. For example, getting Jekyll up and running on an Ubuntu machine was as easy as the following command:\n\n`sudo apt-get install jekyll`Then just start up a new project:\n\n`jekyll new mytestsite`You’ll have the makings of a new site in the “mytestsite” directory with a number of default files. Take note of the “\\_posts” directory, which contains a Markdown file.\n\n### 2. You Can Work on Your Site While Offline\n\nStatic site generators are designed to work with offline, local content. There’s no need for a live internet connection to create a new post. You can draft the content, then run a “build” command later to create the post/page that will make its way to the Web. If you’re used to [offline blog editors such as BlogDesk](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-alternatives-to-windows-live-writer-for-blogging/)   [4 Alternatives To Windows Live Writer For Blogging](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-alternatives-to-windows-live-writer-for-blogging/)     [4 Alternatives To Windows Live Writer For Blogging](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-alternatives-to-windows-live-writer-for-blogging/) Microsoft recently announced the end of the Windows Live brand. In response to concerns, all Microsoft is saying about Windows Live Writer is it will “work great on Windows 8” – not whether development is... [Read More](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-alternatives-to-windows-live-writer-for-blogging/)   it’s similar, except instead of pushing posts one at a time, you’re building the whole site locally.\n\nNext, create your content in the “\\_posts” folder mentioned above. You can build your site when you’re ready by executing the following command from the project’s directory:\n\n`jekyll serve`This builds the entire site in a sub-folder, as shown below:\n\nWhen complete, you can also view this site using Jekyll’s built-in web server at .\n\nIf you like what you see, you can simply upload all the files in the “\\_sites” folder to [a web host](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-web-server-makeuseof-explains/)   [What Is a Web Server? \\[MakeUseOf Explains\\]](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-web-server-makeuseof-explains/)     [What Is a Web Server? \\[MakeUseOf Explains\\]](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-web-server-makeuseof-explains/) If there is one thing that causes the most confusion for people that are new to the web design game, it's the concept of a web server. When most people think of a \"server\", they... [Read More](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-web-server-makeuseof-explains/)  . Your site is ready to go!\n\n### 3. You Can Author Content in Different Formats\n\nAlso, you’re able to create those posts in a format friendlier than raw HTML. Markdown is the most well-supported, but many SSGs can also accept others either out-of-the-box or via a plugin. [Jekyll’s plugins](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#converters) include options like Asciidoc, orgMode, or reStructuredText. If you’re using one of these other markup languages, a quick config change or plugin install should be all you need.\n\nImage Credit: GitHubInterestingly, most SSGs also accept **HTML** as an input. “Wait,” you’re saying. “I thought converting to HTML was the point of this whole thing!” But consider this: other formats not directly supported by SSGs can often export to HTML. Imagine a workflow where you (or other writers) author in LibreOffice using ODT, which gets converted (such as [via Pandoc](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/easily-convert-document-formats-linux/)   [How to Easily Convert Between Document Formats in Linux](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/easily-convert-document-formats-linux/)     [How to Easily Convert Between Document Formats in Linux](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/easily-convert-document-formats-linux/) Switching to Linux can result in problems with file compatibility. For instance, documents don't look the same in LibreOffice as they do in Word. This is just one reason why you need pandoc. [Read More](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/easily-convert-document-formats-linux/)  ) to raw HTML, which is further processed and styled by the SSG. It would take some elbow grease, but it’s entirely possible!\n\n### 4. You Can Still Benefit From Themes and Plugins\n\nAs mentioned above, most SSGs also support extensions or plugins to provide extra functionality. This range from automatically adding data to the site (e.g. date-based URLs for or related posts) to more “CMS-like” features like user authentication or comments. One plugin for [the DocPad SSG](https://docpad.org) even provides an administration panel!\n\nImage Credit: npm### 5. Static Sites Are Fast\n\nBetween fetching content from the database and running any included code, loading some CMS pages can be sluggish. In contrast, static sites are already in the format the browser will consume. The only delay is in how long it takes the web server to send the page, and [how long it takes the browser to render it](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-do-browsers-display-web-pages-and-why-dont-they-ever-look-the-same/)   [How Do Browsers Display Web Pages, and Why Don't They Ever Look the Same?](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-do-browsers-display-web-pages-and-why-dont-they-ever-look-the-same/)     [How Do Browsers Display Web Pages, and Why Don't They Ever Look the Same?](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-do-browsers-display-web-pages-and-why-dont-they-ever-look-the-same/)  [Read More](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-do-browsers-display-web-pages-and-why-dont-they-ever-look-the-same/)  . But these are both things a CMS-driven site would also have to do.\n\nIn addition, since the output of SSGs is run-of-the-mill HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Just about any web server will serve these (along with any images) without issue. This means if you have your own server (such as a VPS), you have the flexibility of deploying a [lighter web server like lighttpd or nginx](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/linux-web-server-software-apache-alternatives/)   [The Best Linux Web Server Software (& Apache Alternatives)](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/linux-web-server-software-apache-alternatives/)     [The Best Linux Web Server Software (& Apache Alternatives)](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/linux-web-server-software-apache-alternatives/)  [Read More](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/linux-web-server-software-apache-alternatives/)  .\n\n### 6. Static Sites Are Secure\n\nThe multiple moving parts of CMSs like WordPress, Drupal, and others open up attack vectors for the villains of the Interwebs. Access to a PHP file can allow an attacker to execute their own code on your site. A compromised database has [led to headaches for e-commerce vendors](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/sorry-state-data-security-e-commerce/)   [The Sorry State Of Personal Data Security In E-Commerce](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/sorry-state-data-security-e-commerce/)     [The Sorry State Of Personal Data Security In E-Commerce](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/sorry-state-data-security-e-commerce/) Many of these retailers owe their entire being to the Internet, yet are incapable of following even the most basic of good data practices.

Static Sites Aren’t Subject to Live Upgrades\n\nIf you’ve ever managed a site, you know the moment of dread that comes along with seeing that “Upgrade available!” message in your admin panel.

Although new versions of the SSG tool may be available, these don’t impact anything on your live site. It will continue to chug along, oblivious to any upgrades that may or may not have happened. In the meantime you can upgrade your SSG, publish a new version of the site to test it out, and finally migrate the new version live. The same can be accomplished with CMSes, but not without considering things like database rollbacks and whether new user-generated content will be lost.\n\nTypes of Sites Ill-Suited to Static Site Generators\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nNot all sites are a good fit for static site generators. If you’re putting together a small personal site, or something like a traditional blog (i.e. a daily journal), the simplicity of SSGs might be for you.

But WordPress and its peers still have a number of moving parts. This is overkill for someone who just wants to blog while still **owning** it. A recent answer to this is the **static site generator (SSG)**. Let’s explore why you might want to consider one for your next online project.\n\nWhat Is a Static Site Generator?\n--------------------------------\n\nThe first pages on the Web were just that: individual pages that someone wrote as an HTML file and uploaded to a server. While a modern CMS (Content Management System) presents content as a page, in reality it is mashing up markup, database content, and real-time calculations. They are web applications that help users create content, store it, then serve it up to site visitors.\n\nIn contrast, static site generators are publishing tools. They’re not so different from tools like Adobe Acrobat, which takes an editable format (e.g. Microsoft Word) and [converts it to a format](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-free-online-pdf-tools-save-lot-work/)   [7 Free Online PDF Tools That Could Save You A Lot Of Work](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-free-online-pdf-tools-save-lot-work/)     [7 Free Online PDF Tools That Could Save You A Lot Of Work](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-free-online-pdf-tools-save-lot-work/) The Web is full of awesome little tools that can help you alter PDF files without breaking a sweat. Let's look at lesser known PDF tasks that may come in handy for you. [Read More](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-free-online-pdf-tools-save-lot-work/)   that’s easy to consume (.PDF). In this case, SSGs are doing the following basic tasks:\n\n1. Taking some sort of basic content as input;\n2. Creating nice-looking web content from it, and;\n3. Helping to push that content live to the web.\n\nIn the next section we’ll examine some of the advantages the “static” nature of SSGs provides over today’s CMSs.\n\nAdvantages of Using a Static Site Generator\n-------------------------------------------\n\nFor those used to working in a CMS like WordPress, some of the following will seem like a big change. But they make producing and maintaining some types of sites a lot easier. Let’s take a look at some of these advantages.\n\n_The below sections include commands and output from the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator as an example. If you select a different SSG, the commands will be different, but the concepts are similar._\n\n### 1. Static Sites Don’t Require Complex Installations\n\nA major difference compared to a “traditional” CMS is that you’re installing static site generators on your **local** machine. For example, getting Jekyll up and running on an Ubuntu machine was as easy as the following command:\n\n`sudo apt-get install jekyll`Then just start up a new project:\n\n`jekyll new mytestsite`You’ll have the makings of a new site in the “mytestsite” directory with a number of default files. Take note of the “\\_posts” directory, which contains a Markdown file.\n\n### 2. You Can Work on Your Site While Offline\n\nStatic site generators are designed to work with offline, local content. There’s no need for a live internet connection to create a new post. You can draft the content, then run a “build” command later to create the post/page that will make its way to the Web. If you’re used to [offline blog editors such as BlogDesk](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-alternatives-to-windows-live-writer-for-blogging/)   [4 Alternatives To Windows Live Writer For Blogging](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-alternatives-to-windows-live-writer-for-blogging/)     [4 Alternatives To Windows Live Writer For Blogging](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-alternatives-to-windows-live-writer-for-blogging/) Microsoft recently announced the end of the Windows Live brand. In response to concerns, all Microsoft is saying about Windows Live Writer is it will “work great on Windows 8” – not whether development is... [Read More](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-alternatives-to-windows-live-writer-for-blogging/)   it’s similar, except instead of pushing posts one at a time, you’re building the whole site locally.\n\nNext, create your content in the “\\_posts” folder mentioned above. You can build your site when you’re ready by executing the following command from the project’s directory:\n\n`jekyll serve`This builds the entire site in a sub-folder, as shown below:\n\nWhen complete, you can also view this site using Jekyll’s built-in web server at .\n\nIf you like what you see, you can simply upload all the files in the “\\_sites” folder to [a web host](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-web-server-makeuseof-explains/)   [What Is a Web Server? \\[MakeUseOf Explains\\]](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-web-server-makeuseof-explains/)     [What Is a Web Server? \\[MakeUseOf Explains\\]](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-web-server-makeuseof-explains/) If there is one thing that causes the most confusion for people that are new to the web design game, it's the concept of a web server. When most people think of a \"server\", they... [Read More](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-web-server-makeuseof-explains/)  . Your site is ready to go!\n\n### 3. You Can Author Content in Different Formats\n\nAlso, you’re able to create those posts in a format friendlier than raw HTML. Markdown is the most well-supported, but many SSGs can also accept others either out-of-the-box or via a plugin. [Jekyll’s plugins](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#converters) include options like Asciidoc, orgMode, or reStructuredText. If you’re using one of these other markup languages, a quick config change or plugin install should be all you need.\n\nImage Credit: GitHubInterestingly, most SSGs also accept **HTML** as an input. “Wait,” you’re saying. “I thought converting to HTML was the point of this whole thing!” But consider this: other formats not directly supported by SSGs can often export to HTML. Imagine a workflow where you (or other writers) author in LibreOffice using ODT, which gets converted (such as [via Pandoc](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/easily-convert-document-formats-linux/)   [How to Easily Convert Between Document Formats in Linux](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/easily-convert-document-formats-linux/)     [How to Easily Convert Between Document Formats in Linux](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/easily-convert-document-formats-linux/) Switching to Linux can result in problems with file compatibility. For instance, documents don't look the same in LibreOffice as they do in Word. This is just one reason why you need pandoc. [Read More](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/easily-convert-document-formats-linux/)  ) to raw HTML, which is further processed and styled by the SSG. It would take some elbow grease, but it’s entirely possible!\n\n### 4. You Can Still Benefit From Themes and Plugins\n\nAs mentioned above, most SSGs also support extensions or plugins to provide extra functionality. This range from automatically adding data to the site (e.g. date-based URLs for or related posts) to more “CMS-like” features like user authentication or comments. One plugin for [the DocPad SSG](https://docpad.org) even provides an administration panel!\n\nImage Credit: npm### 5. Static Sites Are Fast\n\nBetween fetching content from the database and running any included code, loading some CMS pages can be sluggish. In contrast, static sites are already in the format the browser will consume. The only delay is in how long it takes the web server to send the page, and [how long it takes the browser to render it](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-do-browsers-display-web-pages-and-why-dont-they-ever-look-the-same/)   [How Do Browsers Display Web Pages, and Why Don't They Ever Look the Same?](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-do-browsers-display-web-pages-and-why-dont-they-ever-look-the-same/)     [How Do Browsers Display Web Pages, and Why Don't They Ever Look the Same?](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-do-browsers-display-web-pages-and-why-dont-they-ever-look-the-same/)  [Read More](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-do-browsers-display-web-pages-and-why-dont-they-ever-look-the-same/)  . But these are both things a CMS-driven site would also have to do.\n\nIn addition, since the output of SSGs is run-of-the-mill HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Just about any web server will serve these (along with any images) without issue. This means if you have your own server (such as a VPS), you have the flexibility of deploying a [lighter web server like lighttpd or nginx](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/linux-web-server-software-apache-alternatives/)   [The Best Linux Web Server Software (& Apache Alternatives)](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/linux-web-server-software-apache-alternatives/)     [The Best Linux Web Server Software (& Apache Alternatives)](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/linux-web-server-software-apache-alternatives/)  [Read More](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/linux-web-server-software-apache-alternatives/)  .\n\n### 6. Static Sites Are Secure\n\nThe multiple moving parts of CMSs like WordPress, Drupal, and others open up attack vectors for the villains of the Interwebs. Access to a PHP file can allow an attacker to execute their own code on your site. A compromised database has [led to headaches for e-commerce vendors](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/sorry-state-data-security-e-commerce/)   [The Sorry State Of Personal Data Security In E-Commerce](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/sorry-state-data-security-e-commerce/)     [The Sorry State Of Personal Data Security In E-Commerce](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/sorry-state-data-security-e-commerce/) Many of these retailers owe their entire being to the Internet, yet are incapable of following even the most basic of good data practices.

Vue has learned from the experiences of Angular and React and many see it as simpler to implement and understand.\n\nVue.js is lightweight and easily adoptable. It’s reactive and component-based, allowing you to create pluggable components you can add to any project. Most importantly for this tutorial, Vue and its hallmark incremental adoptability allows you to try Vue without putting your existing code base at risk.\n\nVue works well with serverless application architectures. Serverless architectures are becoming the preferred architecture for many developers because it allows them to create and fine-tune products efficiently without having to bear the burdens (server maintenance, outages, and scaling bottlenecks) of traditional server-based architecture. Sarah Drasner recently wrote an entire series on how to [create a serverless checkout flow powered by Vue](https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-one/) and is a good example of this in practice.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to build a marketing website as a serverless Vue.js application using ButterCMS. ButterCMS is a [headless CMS and blogging platform](https://buttercms.com/api-first-cms/) that lets you build CMS-powered apps using any programming language, including Vue. There are other options for going with a [headless CMS](https://css-tricks.com/tag/headless-cms/), but I happen to develop for ButterCMS and know it extremely well so that's what we'll be using in our examples.\n\n\n\nThis tutorial will show you how to add performant content APIs to your Vue.js application. These APIs are easy to navigate even for the non-technical members of your team, enabling you to enjoy agile content management without having to spin up and maintain your own CMS infrastructure.\n\nSpecifically, we’ll examine code samples for three content types we might find on a marketing website: customer case studies, frequently asked questions, and blog posts.\n\nNote that the designs in the screenshots we use throughout this post will likely differ from what you build and are styled with light CSS for demonstration. Your real design would use the global styling from your app making the pages look consistent with the rest of your site.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nWe're using ButterCMS as our content management system, so let's install it:\n\n``npm install buttercms --save``Once installed, you can proceed with the following examples.\n\n### Example 1: Customer Case Studies\n\nLet's start by making it possible for any non-technical person on your team to add customer case studies to the site. In this case, we'll create a page that can hold all of the published case studies that promote the product or service we're selling which, when clicked, open up the page for that case study.\n\n#### Step 1: Setup Customer Case Study Page Type\n\nUsing the dashboard on ButterCMS, you can create a \"page type\" entitled \"Customer Case Study” and define the content fields. Once you’ve done this, you can create your first page. Specify the name and URL of the page using the ButterCMS dashboard and complete the populate the content fields we just defined.\n\nOnce this is all done, the ButterCMS API will return your defined page in JSON format. It should look something like this:\n\n```\n```\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"slug\": \"acme-co\",\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"facebook_open_graph_title\": \"Acme Co loves ButterCMS\",\n      \"seo_title\": \"Acme Co Customer Case Study\",\n      \"headline\": \"Acme Co saved 200% on Anvil costs with ButterCMS\",\n      \"testimonial\": \"We've been able to make anvils faster than ever before! - Chief Anvil Maker\\r\\n\",\n      \"customer_logo\": \"https://cdn.buttercms.com/c8oSTGcwQDC5I58km5WV\",\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```#### Step 2: Integrating Your App\n\nNext, open your code editor and create a file called `buttercms.js` in your `/src` directory.\n\nIf you don’t have an existing project, create one by entering the following:\n\n```\n```\nvue init webpack buttercms-project\ncd buttercms-project\nnpm i\nnpm i -S buttercms\nnpm run dev\n```\n```Then, in `src/buttercms.js`:\n\n```\n```\nimport Butter from 'buttercms';\nconst butter = Butter('your_api_token');\n```\n```Now, update the routes in your app. This is done in `router/index.js`:\n\n```\n```\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport Router from 'vue-router'\nimport CustomersHome from '@/components/CustomersHome'\nimport CustomerPage from '@/components/CustomerPage'\n    \nVue.use(Router)\n\nexport default new Router({\n  mode: 'history',\n  routes: [\n    {\n      path: '/customers/',\n      name: 'customers-home',\n      component: CustomersHome\n    },\n    {\n      path: '/customers/:slug',\n      name: 'customer-page',\n      component: CustomerPage\n    }\n  ]\n})\n```\n```It's worth checking out Hassan Djirdeh's recent post [\"Let's Build a Custom Vue Router\"](https://css-tricks.com/build-a-custom-vue-router) for a deep-dive on using Vue's routing library and methods for creating custom routes.\n\nYou have content in a data file, which is great, but now you need a page that uses the content. You're going to define a `getpages()` method that fetches all of the case study pages so you can render them together on a single landing page to create an index of them all. This will be a \"homepage\" for all of the published case studies.\n\nIn `components/CustomersHome.vue` you add:\n\n```\n```\n\n  // import ButterCMS from \n  import { butter } from '@/buttercms'\n  export default {\n    name: 'customers-home',\n    data() {\n      return {\n        page_title: 'Customers',\n        // Create array to hold the pages from ButterCMS API\n        pages: []\n      }\n    },\n    methods: {\n      // Get List of Customer Pages\n      getPages() {\n        butter.page.list('customer_case_study')\n          .then((res) => {\n            // console.log(res.data.data) // Check the results in the console\n            this.pages = res.data.data\n          })\n      }\n    },\n    created() {\n      // Fire on page creation\n      this.getPages()\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n```...and to display the results, one by one:\n\n```\n```\n\n  \n    {{ page_title }}\n    \n      \n        \n          \n          {{ page.fields.headline }}\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n```\n```Here's an example of something close to what you have so far after publishing one case study:\n\nNow, you're going to set up the page we get when clicking on a case study from the homepage. To do so, in `components/CustomerPage.vue` we define a `getPage()` method to get a particular customer page based on its slug:\n\n```\n```\n\n  import { butter } from '@/buttercms'\n  export default {\n    name: 'customer-page',\n    data() {\n      return {\n        slug: this.$route.params.slug,\n        page: {\n          slug: '',\n          fields: {}\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    methods: {\n      getPage() {\n        butter.page.retrieve('customer_case_study', this.slug)\n          .then((res) => {\n            console.log(res.data.data)\n            this.page = res.data.data\n          }).catch((res) => {\n            console.log(res)\n          })\n      }\n    },\n    created() {\n      this.getPage()\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n```And, just like you did for the case studies homepage, you need to display the content by defining a template and calling the content fields you want to show:\n\n```\n```\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    {{ page.fields.headline }}\n    Testimonials\n    \n    \n  \n\n```\n```This should give you something like this:\n\nSuccess! Now you can go directly to a page that lists all published case studies and click on any of them to be taken to the detail page for a specific case study post.\n\n### Example 2: Frequently Asked Questions\n\nNow lets's walk through how to create a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page for the app. We’ll be using ButterCMS \"Content Fields” for this. Content fields are simply global pieces of content that can be managed by your team. This content can span multiple pages and each content field has a unique ID for querying, as you’ll see below.\n\n#### Step 1: Setup Content Fields\n\nFirst, you’ll need to set up some custom content fields. Using the dashboard, you can set up a workspace to organize content fields. Workspaces will allow content editors to curate content without affecting development or the API.\n\nOnce you're in a workspace, click the button to create a new content field. Choose the \"Object\" type and use \"FAQ Headline\" as the name of the field. It will have an API slug of `faq_headline`.\n\nAfter saving, add another field but this time choose the \"Collection\" type and use \"FAQ Items\" as the name of the field. This one will have an `faq_items` API slug. On the next screen, set up two properties for items in the collection and go back to your workspace to update your heading and add some FAQ posts.\n\n#### Step 2: Integrating Your App\n\nNow that you’ve created dynamic content using content fields, it’s time to display it in the app. To do this, you’ll fetch the fields with an API call and reference them in your view. First, set up a route to your FAQ page:\n\nLet's add FAQ routes in `router/index.js`:\n\n```\n```\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport Router from 'vue-router'\n\nimport FAQ from '@/components/FAQ'\n\nVue.use(Router)\n\nexport default new Router({\n  mode: 'history',\n  routes: [\n    {\n      path: '/faq',\n      name: 'faq',\n      component: FAQ\n    }\n  ]\n})\n```\n```Then create `components/FAQ.vue` with a call to get the FAQ content from the API:\n\n```\n```\n\n  import { butter } from '@/buttercms'\n  export default {\n    name: 'faq',\n    data() {\n      return {\n        page_title: 'FAQ',\n        faq_items: []\n      }\n    },\n    methods: {\n      getFaqs() {\n        butter.content.retrieve(['faq_headline', 'faq_items'])\n          .then((res) => {\n            console.log(res.data.data)\n            this.page_title = res.data.data.faq_headline\n            this.faq_items = res.data.data.faq_items\n          })\n      }\n    },\n    created() {\n      this.getFaqs()\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n```Notice that we predefined `page_title` as `FAQ` and then updated it with the API call to the FAQ content fields.\n\nDefine the ``:\n\n```\n```\n\n  \n    {{ page_title }}\n    \n      {{ faq.question }}\n      {{ faq.answer }}\n    \n  \n\n```\n```Your displayed result should look something like this:\n\nNow anyone on your team can update the values from the ButterCMS dashboard and the corresponding content in your app will automatically update.\n\n### Example 3: Blog Posts\n\nLast, we’ll tackle a blog engine for the app.\n\n#### Step 1: Displaying Posts\n\nWe’ll start out by creating a blog route using `vue-router`. To display posts we create a simple `/blog` route in our app and fetch blog posts, as well as a `/blog/:slug` route to handle individual posts.\n\nIn `router/index.js`:\n\n```\n```\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport Router from 'vue-router'\nimport BlogHome from '@/components/BlogHome'\nimport BlogPost from '@/components/BlogPost'\n\nVue.use(Router)\n\nexport default new Router({\n  mode: 'history',\n  routes: [\n    {\n      path: '/blog/',\n      name: 'blog-home',\n      component: BlogHome\n    },\n    {\n      path: '/blog/:slug',\n      name: 'blog-post',\n      component: BlogPost\n    }\n  ]\n})\n```\n```#### Step 2: Creating the Blog Homepage\n\nTo create your blog homepage that displays the most recently published posts, you’ll create a Vue component for the blog home in a new `components/BlogHome.vue` file:\n\n```\n```\n\n  import { butter } from '@/buttercms'\n  export default {\n    name: 'blog-home',\n    data() {\n      return {\n        page_title: 'Blog',\n        posts: []\n      }\n    },\n    methods: {\n      getPosts() {\n        butter.post.list({\n          page: 1,\n          page_size: 10\n        }).then((res) => {\n          // console.log(res.data)\n          this.posts = res.data.data\n        })\n      }\n    },\n    created() {\n      this.getPosts()\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n```If you have been following along with the previous examples, then you may start to see a pattern here and know that you need to display the content by defining the template and calling the fields in the same component file:\n\n```\n```\n\n  \n      {{ page_title }}\n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n              \n              \n            \n            {{ post.title }}\n            {{ post.summary }}\n          \n        \n      \n  \n\n```\n```Assuming your fields match the example, your blog homepage should look something like this:\n\n#### Step 3: Creating a Blog Post\n\nNext, create a new `components/BlogPost.vue` file which will be your view for a single post:\n\n```\n```\n\n  import { butter } from '@/buttercms'\n  export default {\n    name: 'blog-post',\n    data() {\n      return {\n        post: {}\n      }\n    },\n    methods: {\n      getPost() {\n        butter.post.retrieve(this.$route.params.slug)\n          .then((res) => {\n            // console.log(res.data)\n            this.post = res.data\n          }).catch((res) => {\n            console.log(res)\n          })\n      }\n    },\n    created() {\n      this.getPost()\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n```You may have guessed it, but now you need to define the template and make a call to the blog post content fields:\n\n```\n```\n\n  \n    {{ post.data.title }}\n    {{ post.data.author.first_name }} {{ post.data.author.last_name }}\n    \n\n    \n      {{ post.meta.previous_post.title }}\n    \n    \n      {{ post.meta.next_post.title }}\n    \n  \n\n```\n```Again, assuming you're using similar fields as the example, this is what you might expect to see:\n\n#### Step 4: Handling Blog Post Routes\n\nAt this point, your app is pulling all blog posts, allowing you to navigate to individual posts. But, you will notice the next/previous buttons in the browser aren’t working. Why? When using routes with `params`, the same component instance will be reused when the user navigates from `/blog/foo` to `/blog/bar`.\n\nSince both routes render the same component, this is more efficient than destroying the old instance and creating a new one. But, this also means that the lifecycle hooks of the component will not be called.\n\nThere is a fix for this. We need to watch the `$route` object and call `getPost()` when the route changes. To do this, update the script section in `components/BlogPost.vue`:\n\n```\n```\n\n  import { butter } from '@/buttercms'\n  export default {\n    name: 'blog-post',\n    data() {\n      return {\n        post: {}\n      }\n    },\n    methods: {\n      getPost() {\n        butter.post.retrieve(this.$route.params.slug)\n          .then((res) => {\n            // console.log(res.data)\n            this.post = res.data\n          }).catch((res) => {\n            console.log(res)\n          })\n      }\n    },\n    watch: {\n      $route(to, from) {\n        this.getPost()\n      }\n    },\n    created() {\n      this.getPost()\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n```At this point, your app has a working blog that can be updated easily from the CMS dashboard.\n\nYou can also use APIs to filter and feature content on your blog with categories, tags, and authors. In fact, there’s a lot you can do with an API in terms of managing different aspects of your blog, including RSS, Atom feeds, sitemap markup, and content styling with CSS.\n\n### API or GIT Based Approach\n\nA Git-based approach to managing content\n\nThe premise is that you can leverage modern frontend tooling to create lighter, faster, more secure sites. And FYI, this isn't fringe developer extravaganza. Entire organizations like Smashing Magazine, Sequoia Capital & Mailchimp have migrated to frontend tooling. \nOne of the first implications here is decoupling the building & hosting of your site. You can \"pre-bake\" and pre-build assets and then serve them on Content Delivery Networks. This effectively frees your content from the database/templates imperatives of traditional CMS, like Wordpress and Drupal.\nHowever, the content itself still needs to live somewhere. That's where GIT comes in.\nTo create your site, you can use a static site generator like Spike, the one implemented as standard by WebriQ or a JS framework like Ember, Angular, React, or Vue. It doesn't matter. The point is you store the site's content in a GitHub repository, where most of your pages can be simple Markdown files. Then, you deploy & host that static content on a content delivery delivery network of your choice. \nWebriQ CMS is a Git-based, open source Ember CMS. \nThe CMS is part of an [APP](https://app.webriq.com) to build, manage, update and host sites build with unique front end tools. With WebriQ CMS your content lives in Github and the CMS leverages Github's API to interact directly with your content repository. The WebriQ API allows the CMS to interact directly with the Github repository. It loops editors directly in to Github workflow. \nYou can see our Git based CMS in action on [WEBRIQ CMS DEMO](https://app.webriq.com/help/page/demo/howto)\n\n \n\n\n\n",

Vue has learned from the experiences of Angular and React and many see it as simpler to implement and understand.\n\nVue.js is lightweight and easily adoptable. It’s reactive and component-based, allowing you to create pluggable components you can add to any project. Most importantly for this tutorial, Vue and its hallmark incremental adoptability allows you to try Vue without putting your existing code base at risk.\n\nVue works well with serverless application architectures. Serverless architectures are becoming the preferred architecture for many developers because it allows them to create and fine-tune products efficiently without having to bear the burdens (server maintenance, outages, and scaling bottlenecks) of traditional server-based architecture. Sarah Drasner recently wrote an entire series on how to [create a serverless checkout flow powered by Vue](https://css-tricks.com/creating-vue-js-serverless-checkout-part-one/) and is a good example of this in practice.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to build a marketing website as a serverless Vue.js application using ButterCMS. ButterCMS is a [headless CMS and blogging platform](https://buttercms.com/api-first-cms/) that lets you build CMS-powered apps using any programming language, including Vue. There are other options for going with a [headless CMS](https://css-tricks.com/tag/headless-cms/), but I happen to develop for ButterCMS and know it extremely well so that's what we'll be using in our examples.\n\n\n\nThis tutorial will show you how to add performant content APIs to your Vue.js application. These APIs are easy to navigate even for the non-technical members of your team, enabling you to enjoy agile content management without having to spin up and maintain your own CMS infrastructure.\n\nSpecifically, we’ll examine code samples for three content types we might find on a marketing website: customer case studies, frequently asked questions, and blog posts.\n\nNote that the designs in the screenshots we use throughout this post will likely differ from what you build and are styled with light CSS for demonstration. Your real design would use the global styling from your app making the pages look consistent with the rest of your site.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nWe're using ButterCMS as our content management system, so let's install it:\n\n``npm install buttercms --save``Once installed, you can proceed with the following examples.\n\n### Example 1: Customer Case Studies\n\nLet's start by making it possible for any non-technical person on your team to add customer case studies to the site. In this case, we'll create a page that can hold all of the published case studies that promote the product or service we're selling which, when clicked, open up the page for that case study.\n\n#### Step 1: Setup Customer Case Study Page Type\n\nUsing the dashboard on ButterCMS, you can create a \"page type\" entitled \"Customer Case Study” and define the content fields. Once you’ve done this, you can create your first page. Specify the name and URL of the page using the ButterCMS dashboard and complete the populate the content fields we just defined.\n\nOnce this is all done, the ButterCMS API will return your defined page in JSON format. It should look something like this:\n\n```\n```\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"slug\": \"acme-co\",\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"facebook_open_graph_title\": \"Acme Co loves ButterCMS\",\n      \"seo_title\": \"Acme Co Customer Case Study\",\n      \"headline\": \"Acme Co saved 200% on Anvil costs with ButterCMS\",\n      \"testimonial\": \"We've been able to make anvils faster than ever before! - Chief Anvil Maker\\r\\n\",\n      \"customer_logo\": \"https://cdn.buttercms.com/c8oSTGcwQDC5I58km5WV\",\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```#### Step 2: Integrating Your App\n\nNext, open your code editor and create a file called `buttercms.js` in your `/src` directory.\n\nIf you don’t have an existing project, create one by entering the following:\n\n```\n```\nvue init webpack buttercms-project\ncd buttercms-project\nnpm i\nnpm i -S buttercms\nnpm run dev\n```\n```Then, in `src/buttercms.js`:\n\n```\n```\nimport Butter from 'buttercms';\nconst butter = Butter('your_api_token');\n```\n```Now, update the routes in your app. This is done in `router/index.js`:\n\n```\n```\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport Router from 'vue-router'\nimport CustomersHome from '@/components/CustomersHome'\nimport CustomerPage from '@/components/CustomerPage'\n    \nVue.use(Router)\n\nexport default new Router({\n  mode: 'history',\n  routes: [\n    {\n      path: '/customers/',\n      name: 'customers-home',\n      component: CustomersHome\n    },\n    {\n      path: '/customers/:slug',\n      name: 'customer-page',\n      component: CustomerPage\n    }\n  ]\n})\n```\n```It's worth checking out Hassan Djirdeh's recent post [\"Let's Build a Custom Vue Router\"](https://css-tricks.com/build-a-custom-vue-router) for a deep-dive on using Vue's routing library and methods for creating custom routes.\n\nYou have content in a data file, which is great, but now you need a page that uses the content.

It will have an API slug of `faq_headline`.\n\nAfter saving, add another field but this time choose the \"Collection\" type and use \"FAQ Items\" as the name of the field. This one will have an `faq_items` API slug. On the next screen, set up two properties for items in the collection and go back to your workspace to update your heading and add some FAQ posts.\n\n#### Step 2: Integrating Your App\n\nNow that you’ve created dynamic content using content fields, it’s time to display it in the app. To do this, you’ll fetch the fields with an API call and reference them in your view. First, set up a route to your FAQ page:\n\nLet's add FAQ routes in `router/index.js`:\n\n```\n```\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport Router from 'vue-router'\n\nimport FAQ from '@/components/FAQ'\n\nVue.use(Router)\n\nexport default new Router({\n  mode: 'history',\n  routes: [\n    {\n      path: '/faq',\n      name: 'faq',\n      component: FAQ\n    }\n  ]\n})\n```\n```Then create `components/FAQ.vue` with a call to get the FAQ content from the API:\n\n```\n```\n\n  import { butter } from '@/buttercms'\n  export default {\n    name: 'faq',\n    data() {\n      return {\n        page_title: 'FAQ',\n        faq_items: []\n      }\n    },\n    methods: {\n      getFaqs() {\n        butter.content.retrieve(['faq_headline', 'faq_items'])\n          .then((res) => {\n            console.log(res.data.data)\n            this.page_title = res.data.data.faq_headline\n            this.faq_items = res.data.data.faq_items\n          })\n      }\n    },\n    created() {\n      this.getFaqs()\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n```Notice that we predefined `page_title` as `FAQ` and then updated it with the API call to the FAQ content fields.\n\nDefine the ``:\n\n```\n```\n\n  \n    {{ page_title }}\n    \n      {{ faq.question }}\n      {{ faq.answer }}\n    \n  \n\n```\n```Your displayed result should look something like this:\n\nNow anyone on your team can update the values from the ButterCMS dashboard and the corresponding content in your app will automatically update.\n\n### Example 3: Blog Posts\n\nLast, we’ll tackle a blog engine for the app.\n\n#### Step 1: Displaying Posts\n\nWe’ll start out by creating a blog route using `vue-router`. To display posts we create a simple `/blog` route in our app and fetch blog posts, as well as a `/blog/:slug` route to handle individual posts.\n\nIn `router/index.js`:\n\n```\n```\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport Router from 'vue-router'\nimport BlogHome from '@/components/BlogHome'\nimport BlogPost from '@/components/BlogPost'\n\nVue.use(Router)\n\nexport default new Router({\n  mode: 'history',\n  routes: [\n    {\n      path: '/blog/',\n      name: 'blog-home',\n      component: BlogHome\n    },\n    {\n      path: '/blog/:slug',\n      name: 'blog-post',\n      component: BlogPost\n    }\n  ]\n})\n```\n```#### Step 2: Creating the Blog Homepage\n\nTo create your blog homepage that displays the most recently published posts, you’ll create a Vue component for the blog home in a new `components/BlogHome.vue` file:\n\n```\n```\n\n  import { butter } from '@/buttercms'\n  export default {\n    name: 'blog-home',\n    data() {\n      return {\n        page_title: 'Blog',\n        posts: []\n      }\n    },\n    methods: {\n      getPosts() {\n        butter.post.list({\n          page: 1,\n          page_size: 10\n        }).then((res) => {\n          // console.log(res.data)\n          this.posts = res.data.data\n        })\n      }\n    },\n    created() {\n      this.getPosts()\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n```If you have been following along with the previous examples, then you may start to see a pattern here and know that you need to display the content by defining the template and calling the fields in the same component file:\n\n```\n```\n\n  \n      {{ page_title }}\n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n              \n              \n              \n            \n            {{ post.title }}\n            {{ post.summary }}\n          \n        \n      \n  \n\n```\n```Assuming your fields match the example, your blog homepage should look something like this:\n\n#### Step 3: Creating a Blog Post\n\nNext, create a new `components/BlogPost.vue` file which will be your view for a single post:\n\n```\n```\n\n  import { butter } from '@/buttercms'\n  export default {\n    name: 'blog-post',\n    data() {\n      return {\n        post: {}\n      }\n    },\n    methods: {\n      getPost() {\n        butter.post.retrieve(this.$route.params.slug)\n          .then((res) => {\n            // console.log(res.data)\n            this.post = res.data\n          }).catch((res) => {\n            console.log(res)\n          })\n      }\n    },\n    created() {\n      this.getPost()\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n```You may have guessed it, but now you need to define the template and make a call to the blog post content fields:\n\n```\n```\n\n  \n    {{ post.data.title }}\n    {{ post.data.author.first_name }} {{ post.data.author.last_name }}\n    \n\n    \n      {{ post.meta.previous_post.title }}\n    \n    \n      {{ post.meta.next_post.title }}\n    \n  \n\n```\n```Again, assuming you're using similar fields as the example, this is what you might expect to see:\n\n#### Step 4: Handling Blog Post Routes\n\nAt this point, your app is pulling all blog posts, allowing you to navigate to individual posts. But, you will notice the next/previous buttons in the browser aren’t working. Why? When using routes with `params`, the same component instance will be reused when the user navigates from `/blog/foo` to `/blog/bar`.\n\nSince both routes render the same component, this is more efficient than destroying the old instance and creating a new one. But, this also means that the lifecycle hooks of the component will not be called.\n\nThere is a fix for this. We need to watch the `$route` object and call `getPost()` when the route changes. To do this, update the script section in `components/BlogPost.vue`:\n\n```\n```\n\n  import { butter } from '@/buttercms'\n  export default {\n    name: 'blog-post',\n    data() {\n      return {\n        post: {}\n      }\n    },\n    methods: {\n      getPost() {\n        butter.post.retrieve(this.$route.params.slug)\n          .then((res) => {\n            // console.log(res.data)\n            this.post = res.data\n          }).catch((res) => {\n            console.log(res)\n          })\n      }\n    },\n    watch: {\n      $route(to, from) {\n        this.getPost()\n      }\n    },\n    created() {\n      this.getPost()\n    }\n  }\n\n```\n```At this point, your app has a working blog that can be updated easily from the CMS dashboard.\n\nYou can also use APIs to filter and feature content on your blog with categories, tags, and authors. In fact, there’s a lot you can do with an API in terms of managing different aspects of your blog, including RSS, Atom feeds, sitemap markup, and content styling with CSS.\n\n### API or GIT Based Approach\n\nA Git-based approach to managing content\n\nThe premise is that you can leverage modern frontend tooling to create lighter, faster, more secure sites. And FYI, this isn't fringe developer extravaganza. Entire organizations like Smashing Magazine, Sequoia Capital & Mailchimp have migrated to frontend tooling. \nOne of the first implications here is decoupling the building & hosting of your site. You can \"pre-bake\" and pre-build assets and then serve them on Content Delivery Networks. This effectively frees your content from the database/templates imperatives of traditional CMS, like Wordpress and Drupal.\nHowever, the content itself still needs to live somewhere. That's where GIT comes in.\nTo create your site, you can use a static site generator like Spike, the one implemented as standard by WebriQ or a JS framework like Ember, Angular, React, or Vue. It doesn't matter. The point is you store the site's content in a GitHub repository, where most of your pages can be simple Markdown files. Then, you deploy & host that static content on a content delivery delivery network of your choice. \nWebriQ CMS is a Git-based, open source Ember CMS. \nThe CMS is part of an [APP](https://app.webriq.com) to build, manage, update and host sites build with unique front end tools. With WebriQ CMS your content lives in Github and the CMS leverages Github's API to interact directly with your content repository. The WebriQ API allows the CMS to interact directly with the Github repository. It loops editors directly in to Github workflow. \nYou can see our Git based CMS in action on [WEBRIQ CMS DEMO](https://app.webriq.com/help/page/demo/howto)\n\n \n\n\n\n",

This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla JavaScript (e.g. React, Vue, Angular, etc.).\n\n**Reusable APIs**—Any complex business logic such as user databases and content management are processed server-side and served as APIs to the frontend.\n\n**Markup**—The HTML markup is prebuilt at deploy.\n\nIn short, JAMStack is a web development architecture that’s about developing websites using tools that are loosely coupled . The objective is to decouple the user interface from the Content Management System (CMS).\n\nIn most popular CMSes, (e.g. WordPress, Drupal, Django CMS) the CMS is responsible for both managing content and displaying the user interface, usually through the use of templates specifically designed for that CMS.\n\nIn the JAMStack architecture, the responsibilities of managing content and displaying it are separated.\n\n# What JAM Stack Can Do for You\nIf you’re sure that your needs extend beyond simple requirements, or if you’re frustrated with conventional CMSes, here’s a breakdown on why JAM Stack is worth a shot.\n\n### **FASTER DEVELOPMENT**\nWith most traditional CMSes, only the seasoned veterans are on the ball.

But if you’re going to build a website with plenty of features, dynamic content, and interactive components, you’ll want to ensure that you’re not limited to the tools or architecture that’s provided by your content management system.\n\nBesides, most modern JavaScript plugins are agnostic to the platform that you are using. Tools like Customer Relationship Management systems, Email Newsletters, can all easily integrate with the architecture, either directly or through a service like Zapier.\n\n\n### **BETTER PERFORMANCE**\nYou can deploy your whole website onto a Content Delivery Network. Services like Netlify allow you to do this with very minimal effort. This means content can be downloaded quickly from nearby servers as opposed to a single server that could be distant from the user’s location.\n\n\n### **SMOOTHER USER EXPERIENCE**\nWhen using modern JavaScript frameworks to build websites, smooth animations can be added so that content transitions are seamless. These subtle improvements in page load speed can enhance the user’s experience of your brand touchpoint. Even though one cannot control user behaviour, these advantages can influence users’ perception of your brand.\n\n\n### **TIGHTER SECURITY**\nAs the user interface is separate from your CMS, it is significantly harder to hack JAMStack websites.

        "content": "\nThe difference between a Wordpress website and a Static site is well described in one of David Walsh blog posts. \n### How does a Wordpress website work\nTry to imagine for a second that the only way for people to know what's happening in the world is to go to the nearby news kiosk and ask to read the latest news. The attendant has no way to know what the latest news is, so he passes the request on to a back room full of telephone operators. When an operator becomes available, they will take the request and phone a long list of news agencies, ask for the latest news and then write the results as bullet points on a piece of paper. The operator will then pass his rough notes on to a scribbler who will write the final copy to a nice sheet of paper, arrange them in a certain layout and add a few bits and pieces such as the kiosk branding and contact information. Finally, the attendant takes the finished paper and serves it to the happy customer. The entire process will then be repeated for every person that arrives at the kiosk.\nThat is essentially how dynamic websites work. When a visitor gets to a website (the kiosk) expecting the latest content (the news), a server-side script (the operators) will query one or multiple databases (news agencies) to get the content, pass the results to a templating engine (the scribble) who will format and arrange everything properly and generate an HTML file (the finished newspaper) for the user to consume.\n### How static sites work\nThe proposition of a static site is to shift the heavy load from the moment visitors request the content to the moment content actually changes. Going back to our kiosk metaphor, think of a scenario where it's the news agencies who call the kiosk whenever something newsworthy happens. The kiosk operators and scribbles will then compile, format and style the stories and produce a finished newspaper right away, even though nobody ordered one yet. They will print out a huge number of copies (infinite, actually) and pile them up by the store front. When customers arrive, there's no need to wait for an operator to become available, place the phone call, pass the results to the scribble and wait for the final product. The newspaper is already there, waiting in a pile, so the customer can be served instantly.\nAnd that is how static site generators work. They take the content, typically stored in flat files rather than databases, apply it against layouts or templates and generate a structure of purely static HTML files that are ready to be delivered to the users.\nWith an ever-growing ecosystem surrounding static site development, many of the main issues surrounding building static sites are finding answers through new tools.\nContent management and administrative tasks can be challenging for end users who don’t have a technical background. Good news is there's an impressive number of  CMSs out there ready to complete your Static site. The difference between those CMSs and traditional CMSs, like Wordpress, being that you'll use the former only for \"content management\" tasks, not templating and frontend content generation, making it easier for content manager and editors to contribute to the content of the website or the web application.\nBuilding websites using Static Site generators is often referred to the term JAMstack, stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup, and it describes a way of building static, database-free websites. This concept is deceptively simple– the word ‘static’ implies simplicity, or a lack of interactivity, but this could not be further from the truth. When we talk about static websites, we’re referring to the technology used to build, power, and serve them.\n\n### Beyond simplicity the main advantages of the JAMstack are \n-\t**SEO** : First, simplifying your URLs and site architecture is often easier with JAMstack than it is with a dynamic website and full CMS. Rather than relying on complex server-side URL rewrites to make your content available at pretty URLs (example.com/?p=12345 → example.com/nice-and-tidy/), your URLs can be whatever you want them to be: they simply reflect the locations of your website’s files.\nThe potential for unwanted duplication is also massively reduced. Many CMSs will automatically generate pages for categories, tags, and date-based archives which you may not even need. Typically, such pages are handled with no index directives or canonicalization using extra plugins. Static site generators instead allow you to fine-tune page creation and create whatever taxonomy suits your content. Should you require it, many generators include powerful logic and functions for creating filtered, paginated archives.\n-\t**Speed** - Closely related to SEO, but obviously critical for UX too, is speed.\nThe speed advantages of static websites can be phenomenal. With HTML generated in advance and database queries eliminated, your content can be served instantly from a global CDN. An experiment by Mathias Biilmann for Smashing Magazine found that with a highly optimized dynamic website (including a robust caching implementation), the time to first byte was on average six times faster using a static version distributed via CDN. Back in 2010, Google said page speed was a ranking factor but it “was focused on desktop searches” only. Now, in July 2018, it will look at how fast your mobile pages are and use that as a ranking factor in mobile search. Google has been promising to look at mobile page speed for years now, and it is finally there. \n-\t**Security** – your website build with a Static Site Generator is an absolute fortress, plain and simple.\n-\t**Deployment and workflow** – A core principle of JAMstack development is that everything lives in a Git repository; everything from our static sites components, generator config files, CSS & JS, to our written content (saved as plain-text markdown documents). With your hosting/deployment service configured to continuously mirror the appropriate branch of your repository, making a change can be as simple as pushing a commit to GitHub. Your entire website – code and content – lives in one centralized location protected by robust version control, and can be setup for continuous deployment.\n-\t**An exploding user and development community **- Take ecommerce, for example. For smaller retailers – the kind who might typically rely on WordPress and WooCommerce – a static website is now a totally viable option. Snipcart is a JavaScript-based shopping cart and checkout system which allows developers to add ecommerce functionality to any website. Product inventory and sales are managed through the Snipcart dashboard, and its API allows integration with inventory management systems, shipping providers, and so on. Alternative solutions include Foxycart and the Shopify buy button.\n\nFor bloggers who would typically use a pre-built theme for their site, there are now hundreds of options. It’s worth mentioning that some technical know-how is still required to get up-and-running with one of these static generators. They’re certainly a long-way off becoming thriving theme marketplaces in their own right, but in a way that’s a good thing: bloated themes stuffed with unnecessary plugins and page builder tools are not a problem here!\n\n\n### The future of Static Site Generators\nA common question that arises when a frontend tool, workflow or library becomes popular is, how long will it last? It’s tough to say how reliable these predictions are, but based on the track record of the web—static sites were around in the early days of the web and are still heavily used—static sites are likely a mainstay for the foreseeable future.\nA feature that we’ll likely see moving forward is interface improvement for non-technical users. Currently, static site generators are heavily geared towards developers; “for developers by developers”. Many of them utilize the command line and rely on markdown as input for content; without a user friendly GUI interface to manage content. Thankfully, we’ve already seen the Headless CMS movement emerge to address this with content creating and editing experiences that prioritize non-developers. Solutions like Contentful, Prismic and Forestry provide proprietary solutions while Netlify CMS, WebriQ CMS and Strapi are fully open soure. With these solutions, a content creator doesn’t need to be privy to the intricacies of the build and can focus on creating content.\nAnother feature that will likely grow over the next few years is the integration of serverless functions in static site generators. You can easily enrich your JAMstack site with dynamic functionality by including third party services and APIs. By default, a static site—being static—doesn’t allow for this functionality. Relying on third party services to handle this functionality may add unnecessary load that will slow down the performance of your site and expose you to potential security exploits.\nA good alternative that has been slowly gaining momentum are serverless functions. Serverless architectures encourage business-logic driven development, without making premature optimizations. As an architecture that scales well and is still easy to maintain, serverless functions fit in with the paradigm of lightweight aesthetic of static sites. Though serverless functions are still in their infancy, you can start using serverless functions in your static sites today using Netlify Functions, which lets you deploy Lambda functions without an AWS account, and with function management handled directly within Netlify.\n\n## How can your company benefit from the JAMstack and this web development revolution?\nIn this rapid changing web development environment, it is hard to keep up with all the changes, especially when you do not have an internal team that can support your web and digital marketing efforts. It is important to have access to a pool of competencies and people that can design and develop your website or web application and give it the right look and feel that potential customers will be attracted by it. You need access to people that can help you create the needed visibility for your website and can produce the necessary content to enable viewers and customers to easily find you on the Internet. You need a team of forward thinking developers and designers that can make an impact on how your viewers and customers experience your website or web application.\n\nAt WebriQ, we have been developing and deploying JAM Stack websites for over two years now. With a dedicated [APP](http://app.webriq.com), we have been able to build, develop, update and manage hunderds of sites.

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\nThe difference between a Wordpress website and a Static site is well described in one of David Walsh blog posts. \n### How does a Wordpress website work\nTry to imagine for a second that the only way for people to know what's happening in the world is to go to the nearby news kiosk and ask to read the latest news. The attendant has no way to know what the latest news is, so he passes the request on to a back room full of telephone operators. When an operator becomes available, they will take the request and phone a long list of news agencies, ask for the latest news and then write the results as bullet points on a piece of paper. The operator will then pass his rough notes on to a scribbler who will write the final copy to a nice sheet of paper, arrange them in a certain layout and add a few bits and pieces such as the kiosk branding and contact information. Finally, the attendant takes the finished paper and serves it to the happy customer. The entire process will then be repeated for every person that arrives at the kiosk.\nThat is essentially how dynamic websites work. When a visitor gets to a website (the kiosk) expecting the latest content (the news), a server-side script (the operators) will query one or multiple databases (news agencies) to get the content, pass the results to a templating engine (the scribble) who will format and arrange everything properly and generate an HTML file (the finished newspaper) for the user to consume.\n### How static sites work\nThe proposition of a static site is to shift the heavy load from the moment visitors request the content to the moment content actually changes. Going back to our kiosk metaphor, think of a scenario where it's the news agencies who call the kiosk whenever something newsworthy happens. The kiosk operators and scribbles will then compile, format and style the stories and produce a finished newspaper right away, even though nobody ordered one yet. They will print out a huge number of copies (infinite, actually) and pile them up by the store front. When customers arrive, there's no need to wait for an operator to become available, place the phone call, pass the results to the scribble and wait for the final product. The newspaper is already there, waiting in a pile, so the customer can be served instantly.\nAnd that is how static site generators work. They take the content, typically stored in flat files rather than databases, apply it against layouts or templates and generate a structure of purely static HTML files that are ready to be delivered to the users.\nWith an ever-growing ecosystem surrounding static site development, many of the main issues surrounding building static sites are finding answers through new tools.\nContent management and administrative tasks can be challenging for end users who don’t have a technical background. Good news is there's an impressive number of  CMSs out there ready to complete your Static site. The difference between those CMSs and traditional CMSs, like Wordpress, being that you'll use the former only for \"content management\" tasks, not templating and frontend content generation, making it easier for content manager and editors to contribute to the content of the website or the web application.\nBuilding websites using Static Site generators is often referred to the term JAMstack, stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup, and it describes a way of building static, database-free websites. This concept is deceptively simple– the word ‘static’ implies simplicity, or a lack of interactivity, but this could not be further from the truth. When we talk about static websites, we’re referring to the technology used to build, power, and serve them.\n\n### Beyond simplicity the main advantages of the JAMstack are \n-\t**SEO** : First, simplifying your URLs and site architecture is often easier with JAMstack than it is with a dynamic website and full CMS. Rather than relying on complex server-side URL rewrites to make your content available at pretty URLs (example.com/?p=12345 → example.com/nice-and-tidy/), your URLs can be whatever you want them to be: they simply reflect the locations of your website’s files.\nThe potential for unwanted duplication is also massively reduced. Many CMSs will automatically generate pages for categories, tags, and date-based archives which you may not even need. Typically, such pages are handled with no index directives or canonicalization using extra plugins. Static site generators instead allow you to fine-tune page creation and create whatever taxonomy suits your content. Should you require it, many generators include powerful logic and functions for creating filtered, paginated archives.\n-\t**Speed** - Closely related to SEO, but obviously critical for UX too, is speed.\nThe speed advantages of static websites can be phenomenal. With HTML generated in advance and database queries eliminated, your content can be served instantly from a global CDN. An experiment by Mathias Biilmann for Smashing Magazine found that with a highly optimized dynamic website (including a robust caching implementation), the time to first byte was on average six times faster using a static version distributed via CDN. Back in 2010, Google said page speed was a ranking factor but it “was focused on desktop searches” only. Now, in July 2018, it will look at how fast your mobile pages are and use that as a ranking factor in mobile search. Google has been promising to look at mobile page speed for years now, and it is finally there. \n-\t**Security** – your website build with a Static Site Generator is an absolute fortress, plain and simple.\n-\t**Deployment and workflow** – A core principle of JAMstack development is that everything lives in a Git repository; everything from our static sites components, generator config files, CSS & JS, to our written content (saved as plain-text markdown documents). With your hosting/deployment service configured to continuously mirror the appropriate branch of your repository, making a change can be as simple as pushing a commit to GitHub. Your entire website – code and content – lives in one centralized location protected by robust version control, and can be setup for continuous deployment.\n-\t**An exploding user and development community **- Take ecommerce, for example. For smaller retailers – the kind who might typically rely on WordPress and WooCommerce – a static website is now a totally viable option. Snipcart is a JavaScript-based shopping cart and checkout system which allows developers to add ecommerce functionality to any website. Product inventory and sales are managed through the Snipcart dashboard, and its API allows integration with inventory management systems, shipping providers, and so on. Alternative solutions include Foxycart and the Shopify buy button.\n\nFor bloggers who would typically use a pre-built theme for their site, there are now hundreds of options.

        "content": "\nThere are basically two popular approaches to take when you decide to build a website. You can go to a static HTML website or a Content Management System (CMS) such as WordPress or Joomla. If you are new to building and managing websites, then you might wonder what the big difference is between these two approaches. They both make websites, but there is a world of difference on how you get to the end result. Read on to find out the difference between them, and which one is really the best for you.\n\nHTML – CSS – JavaScript\n\nA static HTML website is one that you build with HTML and CSS. The reason it’s called a static website is that nothing can change about the website or at least not unless you go back and change the code. Up until recent years, this was really the only way to make a website. There is no dynamic content, nor is there any real user interaction. The only thing you get is what you enter into the HTML. What does that mean? Simply put, once you are done with the design and install the website it will only do what you asked it to. You can make beautiful sites that allow the users to read content, purchase products, access to free offers, sign up for newsletters and build your list. Just about anything you desire you can do with a static HTML website.\n\nThough it’s called an HTML website, there are actually several different coding languages typically used to build an HTML website. HTML provides the structure or the core, but CSS is used to set the look and feel for the visuals and to make look pretty too. You can set the size, colors, fonts, backgrounds… etc. JavaScript can be used to add special effects to the website and even a little dynamic interaction with the user. As you can imagine though if you choose to go this route to create your website you’ll need to know at least the basics of each of the languages used.\n\nA Content Management System (CMS) is much more user-friendly in the sense that you do not need to know any code in order to use it. CMS is more of a “drag and drop” or “point and click” type system. You log in to the “admin” portion of the website and make the changes you desire and update. The changes you make to the appearance or functionality of your website take effect immediately after you save and update. One of the other nice things about CMS is the variety of themes available, but we’ll talk about that later.\n\nMost CMS sites are referred to as Blog sites, primarily due to the fact they were originally used for blogging and not much else. In recent years CMS has become so much more and are now one of the most widely used programs for building a website today. Built using PHP, CMS sites have a database attached to save all of the core and dynamic content. So once again, the biggest differences between CMS and static HTML are dynamic content (change it on the fly) and no coding required.\n\nWordPress or Joomla?\n\nThis is really a matter of choice. Both are very good platforms and for the most part one is as easy to use as the other. The biggest difference between them is this: WordPress has been around since 2003 and is very popular. As a result, they get a huge amount of support from other programmers when it comes to Plugins (we’ll talk about this is a minute) and SEO, and there are a kazillion themes available for WordPress too, thus making it a very popular choice for both newbies and pros alike. Joomla has not been around as long (2005) but has become very popular in its own right over the yeas. It is second only to WordPress and with over 30 million downloads and now with WordPress integration, it’s no slouch. Both allow users to leave comments to posts and or pages, stream new content from sources like social media or news sites and you can also quickly add new posts to your blog without having to worry about modifying your navigation bar (its automatic) or structuring your pages, thanks to built-in templates.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nStatic HTML: Pros – A static HTML website is easy to setup (especially if you know code). You have complete control of the layout, look and feel. HTML websites also tend to load faster because they usually have fewer files and data to download. As stated earlier, a big benefit of HTML is that you have total control over the website’s appearance. You can change the visuals of a WordPress or Joomla site too, but you are limited by the amount of choices or flexibility available with the theme or template you are using. If you know CSS, which is a fairly simple language, then you can easily change the way your HTML website looks.\n\nStatic HTML: Cons – The cons of static HTML deal with its lack of interactivity and their complex structure with larger websites. An HTML page has absolutely no interactivity, and it only includes what you code. For example, if you code a Web page with an article, then that’s all you will get. There will be nothing else on the page except for that article. There will be no user content, no dynamic content that generates while you are away and the website will remain static. On the other hand, if you program it to include a database so that users can access information I guess in a sense you could call that a limited form of interactivity. The same holds true with a shopping cart. A user comes to your website purchase a product or service you offer; so in the same sense they can interact with your website in a limited form.\n\nIf you want to make changes to your site like adding a new post (write a new article) or page you will need to create it first and then upload the HTML file it to your server and then change the navigation bar (menu) before it is visible to the user. This takes up a lot of time, especially if you add one or more pages a day. Another consideration is: if you don’t have a good CSS structure in place then changing parts of your website can be very cumbersome. For example, you want to change the background color for all of your pages on your site. If you have the background color programmed with CSS and have it called out in the HTML for all of the pages, then changing the color in the CSS will change the color on all of the pages on your website. This is huge for website that might have 100 pages or more, otherwise you’ll need to change all 100 pages individually. As you can see, static HTML sites are easy for the guy who understands the code requirements, but not so for that person little to no code knowledge. Finally, SEO! You will need to code all of the SEO into your static website yourself. Considering SEO is a somewhat dynamic process, you will find yourself always having to go back and tweak or change your site to keep it current.\n\nWordPress Pros – As stated earlier – you can use WordPress or Joomla, but for comparison sake, we’ll only refer to WordPress hereafter. WordPress is often considered the best way to setup a website because it is very easy to do and easy for newbies to figure out. A WordPress blog does take some time to setup but not when you consider how long it took someone to write all of the code required for an HTML site. Besides, we’re literally talking hours, not days or weeks, but it would not be out of the ordinary for a web developer to spend days designing a new website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Installing a WordPress blog only takes a few minutes with most hosts, and adding a new theme takes even less time and themes are what WordPress is all about.\n\nLet’s take a minute to talk about themes. Themes or templates allow you to change the look or feel of your website literally in minutes. If you want a particular niche site, for example, a medical looking feel or a golfing theme there are plenty to choose from. Some are free and others you’ll need to purchase, usually referred to as Premium themes. If you just want a blog and a place for people to leave comments, then a free theme will probably do the trick. However, if you want a more professional or storefront to look with maybe a shopping cart or a data feed for an Amazon affiliate, then a premium theme is the way to go. I prefer premium themes because they generally allow for more flexibility and customization.\n\nSEO is another big plus for WordPress because a lot of it is already built into the program. when you install WordPress on your server for the first time you immediately need to go the admin section and complete a setup process located in the settings> general settings area. In there you will fill in a couple of fields that are the beginnings of the SEO process. Afterward, every time you create a page or post you are able to add to your SEO and keep all of your content current and search engine friendly. There are plenty of good plugins you can use that can take your SEO to astronomical levels.\n\nSpeaking of plugins, there are thousands of plugins that add unique and interesting effects to your WordPress website. There are so many choices of plugins that it will be impractical to try and mention them here, but to give you a taste: there are plugins for advertising, SEO, article submission, spam protection, adding captchas, creating contact forms, email campaigns and even ones that will automatically backup your website according to a schedule you setup. The list of plugins goes on forever.\n\nWordPress Cons – One of the problems with WordPress can be too many plugins. I’ve seen websites that take too long to load and it was caused by having way to many plugins installed on the site. Only use what is necessary. Another thing to consider are the themes. Some are clearly better than others. Theme developers put a lot of time and thought into the design, but some developers are really thinking of the end-user more than others and recognize that we want lots of customization freedom and more importantly, not all of us have programming skills so make it simple to understand and use. All of them allow for some customization, but others will give you more control and the ability to make your website look the way you really want it be. All I’m saying is to read the reviews and do your homework before investing in a premium theme. Also, a well designed theme will look clean and load quickly. There are thousands of themes to choose from, so you are sure to find something that you like.\n\nInstalling your WordPress Website\n\nInstalling a WordPress site with most hosts takes only a few minutes. I found GoDaddy to be one of the best web host out there. There is other good web hosting companies and I’ve used several of them and would not hesitate to recommend them, but GoDaddy (in my opinion) has superior customer service. I cannot say enough about a company that has a phone number you can call and an actual customer service person (a real human being) will answer and be there whenever you need them. However, Afterward your choice as to which ever company you decide to use and are more comfortable with.\n\nNow back to installing! Just log in to your web host and follow their instructions for installing WordPress. Afterwards, you’ll need to upload and install your theme. Once that is complete and you received conformation from the server that the website is active, all that is left is to start adding content and customizing your new website and make it look the way you desire.\n\n[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com) - best of both worlds. A Static Site building approach combined with a Git-based CMS system to continuously update your content \n\nWith a Git-based CMS you can publish content every time you push changes to Git, allowing for a seamless development workflow. This approach is a bit difficult to scale with content that you want to publish across different platforms, but it will allow for you to have a purely static website. Since it runs on Git, you won’t have a problem finding an open source CMS to work with.\n\nWith an API-driven CMS, you’re creating content that will be strictly delivered via APIs. Although you won’t be able to keep track of content changes through Git, you’ll be able to scale your content through flexible APIs. But since you are working on a platform that hosts these APIs (server bandwidth ain’t cheap) these tend to not be open-sourced and rather pricey, but some offer freemium pricing models.\n\n",

It is second only to WordPress and with over 30 million downloads and now with WordPress integration, it’s no slouch. Both allow users to leave comments to posts and or pages, stream new content from sources like social media or news sites and you can also quickly add new posts to your blog without having to worry about modifying your navigation bar (its automatic) or structuring your pages, thanks to built-in templates.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nStatic HTML: Pros – A static HTML website is easy to setup (especially if you know code). You have complete control of the layout, look and feel. HTML websites also tend to load faster because they usually have fewer files and data to download. As stated earlier, a big benefit of HTML is that you have total control over the website’s appearance. You can change the visuals of a WordPress or Joomla site too, but you are limited by the amount of choices or flexibility available with the theme or template you are using. If you know CSS, which is a fairly simple language, then you can easily change the way your HTML website looks.\n\nStatic HTML: Cons – The cons of static HTML deal with its lack of interactivity and their complex structure with larger websites. An HTML page has absolutely no interactivity, and it only includes what you code. For example, if you code a Web page with an article, then that’s all you will get. There will be nothing else on the page except for that article. There will be no user content, no dynamic content that generates while you are away and the website will remain static. On the other hand, if you program it to include a database so that users can access information I guess in a sense you could call that a limited form of interactivity. The same holds true with a shopping cart. A user comes to your website purchase a product or service you offer; so in the same sense they can interact with your website in a limited form.\n\nIf you want to make changes to your site like adding a new post (write a new article) or page you will need to create it first and then upload the HTML file it to your server and then change the navigation bar (menu) before it is visible to the user. This takes up a lot of time, especially if you add one or more pages a day. Another consideration is: if you don’t have a good CSS structure in place then changing parts of your website can be very cumbersome. For example, you want to change the background color for all of your pages on your site. If you have the background color programmed with CSS and have it called out in the HTML for all of the pages, then changing the color in the CSS will change the color on all of the pages on your website. This is huge for website that might have 100 pages or more, otherwise you’ll need to change all 100 pages individually. As you can see, static HTML sites are easy for the guy who understands the code requirements, but not so for that person little to no code knowledge. Finally, SEO! You will need to code all of the SEO into your static website yourself. Considering SEO is a somewhat dynamic process, you will find yourself always having to go back and tweak or change your site to keep it current.\n\nWordPress Pros – As stated earlier – you can use WordPress or Joomla, but for comparison sake, we’ll only refer to WordPress hereafter. WordPress is often considered the best way to setup a website because it is very easy to do and easy for newbies to figure out. A WordPress blog does take some time to setup but not when you consider how long it took someone to write all of the code required for an HTML site. Besides, we’re literally talking hours, not days or weeks, but it would not be out of the ordinary for a web developer to spend days designing a new website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Installing a WordPress blog only takes a few minutes with most hosts, and adding a new theme takes even less time and themes are what WordPress is all about.\n\nLet’s take a minute to talk about themes. Themes or templates allow you to change the look or feel of your website literally in minutes. If you want a particular niche site, for example, a medical looking feel or a golfing theme there are plenty to choose from. Some are free and others you’ll need to purchase, usually referred to as Premium themes. If you just want a blog and a place for people to leave comments, then a free theme will probably do the trick. However, if you want a more professional or storefront to look with maybe a shopping cart or a data feed for an Amazon affiliate, then a premium theme is the way to go. I prefer premium themes because they generally allow for more flexibility and customization.\n\nSEO is another big plus for WordPress because a lot of it is already built into the program. when you install WordPress on your server for the first time you immediately need to go the admin section and complete a setup process located in the settings> general settings area. In there you will fill in a couple of fields that are the beginnings of the SEO process. Afterward, every time you create a page or post you are able to add to your SEO and keep all of your content current and search engine friendly. There are plenty of good plugins you can use that can take your SEO to astronomical levels.\n\nSpeaking of plugins, there are thousands of plugins that add unique and interesting effects to your WordPress website. There are so many choices of plugins that it will be impractical to try and mention them here, but to give you a taste: there are plugins for advertising, SEO, article submission, spam protection, adding captchas, creating contact forms, email campaigns and even ones that will automatically backup your website according to a schedule you setup. The list of plugins goes on forever.\n\nWordPress Cons – One of the problems with WordPress can be too many plugins. I’ve seen websites that take too long to load and it was caused by having way to many plugins installed on the site. Only use what is necessary. Another thing to consider are the themes. Some are clearly better than others. Theme developers put a lot of time and thought into the design, but some developers are really thinking of the end-user more than others and recognize that we want lots of customization freedom and more importantly, not all of us have programming skills so make it simple to understand and use. All of them allow for some customization, but others will give you more control and the ability to make your website look the way you really want it be. All I’m saying is to read the reviews and do your homework before investing in a premium theme. Also, a well designed theme will look clean and load quickly. There are thousands of themes to choose from, so you are sure to find something that you like.\n\nInstalling your WordPress Website\n\nInstalling a WordPress site with most hosts takes only a few minutes. I found GoDaddy to be one of the best web host out there. There is other good web hosting companies and I’ve used several of them and would not hesitate to recommend them, but GoDaddy (in my opinion) has superior customer service. I cannot say enough about a company that has a phone number you can call and an actual customer service person (a real human being) will answer and be there whenever you need them. However, Afterward your choice as to which ever company you decide to use and are more comfortable with.\n\nNow back to installing! Just log in to your web host and follow their instructions for installing WordPress. Afterwards, you’ll need to upload and install your theme. Once that is complete and you received conformation from the server that the website is active, all that is left is to start adding content and customizing your new website and make it look the way you desire.\n\n[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com) - best of both worlds. A Static Site building approach combined with a Git-based CMS system to continuously update your content \n\nWith a Git-based CMS you can publish content every time you push changes to Git, allowing for a seamless development workflow. This approach is a bit difficult to scale with content that you want to publish across different platforms, but it will allow for you to have a purely static website. Since it runs on Git, you won’t have a problem finding an open source CMS to work with.\n\nWith an API-driven CMS, you’re creating content that will be strictly delivered via APIs. Although you won’t be able to keep track of content changes through Git, you’ll be able to scale your content through flexible APIs. But since you are working on a platform that hosts these APIs (server bandwidth ain’t cheap) these tend to not be open-sourced and rather pricey, but some offer freemium pricing models.\n\n",
