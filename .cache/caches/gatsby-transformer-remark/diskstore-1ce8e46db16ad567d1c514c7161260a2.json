No side arm action here, This is axe throwing.</p>\n<p>2.One Foot Forward. Now, which one depends on personal preference. If you have thrown a lot put your opposite foot forward. If you don’t know, throw with your same foot forward at first. </p>\n<p>3.Lean Back. When throwing an axe, do not only use your arm, axe throwing is a full body workout. Transfer your weight to your back leg, then,</p>\n<p>4.Lean Forward. Transfer your body weight from back leg to front leg. This is important, this allows you to get enough momentum going forward so you can stick it.</p>\n<p>5.Release.  Now, all this has come down to this very moment.
