## How to Throw An Axe

By **Jack's Axe Throwing, LLC**

This is the magical 7 step formula to throw an axe. Follow these simple steps and you will be well on your way to becoming the champion you want to become.

1.Bicep By your ear This is Critical to start the perfect throw. No side arm action here, This is axe throwing.

2.One Foot Forward. Now, which one depends on personal preference. If you have thrown a lot put your opposite foot forward. If you don’t know, throw with your same foot forward at first. 

3.Lean Back. When throwing an axe, do not only use your arm, axe throwing is a full body workout. Transfer your weight to your back leg, then,

4.Lean Forward. Transfer your body weight from back leg to front leg. This is important, this allows you to get enough momentum going forward so you can stick it.

5.Release.  Now, all this has come down to this very moment. Release at eye level (Or at the center of the bullseye) do not bend the wrist. These axes are balanced, so keep that wrist locked for one flip and a stick at traditional distance of 12-13 feet away from your target.

6.STICK IT! If you follow all of these steps, you have at least a 20% chance of sticking the axe every single time. (Results are not guaranteed, please consult one of our professionals for a chance to better your stick percentage)

7.Become a certified Lumberjack/Lumberjill Whatever you do in life, just keep throwing axes. Jack believes in you, We believe in you, the entire crowd is cheering for you. You can do it! If you keep it up, you are well on your way to become a certified Lumberjill or Lumberjack from Jack himself.  (More on this certification process Later.)
